No response...

Has something happened to Isabella?<End>
A photograph...
<End>
It's a cabin...
Feels like I've seen it before...<End>
The hallway...!<End>
The air duct cover is broken.<End>
Man, this apartment is really falling
apart.
"The Ruins"... they sure got that right.<End>
The air duct cover is off.<End>
Can't believe Uncle Nozz lives here...<End>
The air duct...
I wonder if it leads to the other rooms...<End>
If I had a box to stand on, I could reach it.<End>
Sure, I could go up there.
But I don't need to.<End>
Room numbers are written here.
Uncle Nozz is in Room 205.<End>
Uncle Nozz's phone number is written
on the mail box.<End>
...Did he write this here himself?<End>
Hmm...
It's too dark, I can't see anything.<End>
I need a light.
I can probably find something at
Uncle Nozz's store.<End>
Hmm...?
It won't open... why?<End>
Who the blazes is that?!
What time do you call this?!<End>
Uncle, are you still awake?<End>
...Matthew?<End>
What are you doing here at this hour?<End>
I'm sorry...<End>
Oh, it's all right...<End>
Uncle, do you know Isabella?<End>
Isabella? Don't know her. <End>
I think she lives in this apartment
building.<End>
In this wreck?

Hmm, who do I know who lives here...<End>
Oh! You mean that beautiful lady?<End>
So she DOES live here!<End>
So her name's Isabella...<End>
Do you know what room she's in?<End>
What room? Yes, I think I saw her going
into the furthest room at the other
end of the corridor once. But...<End>
Doesn't she live here?<End>
I don't know...<End>
What do you want with that lady,
anyhow?<End>
Uh...<End>
Oh, I SEE! Well, you've finally reached
that age, huh.<End>
Huh?<End>
Hmm, young men like you do tend to be
drawn in by the older ones.<End>
That's not really...<End>
Still, I think you ought to give up on that
lady.<End>
Why?<End>
I can't say for sure, but I've seen a lot
of dodgy-looking men coming and going
from her apartment.<End>
Dodgy looking men?<End>
One tall guy with mean-looking eyes,
and he brought what looked like his
henchman with him.<End>
Those guys are up to no good, no doubt
about it.<End>
...<End>
I wonder who that was...<End>
I'm sleepy, you know...<End>
I'm sorry...<End>
If this is gonna take a while, could we
do it tomorrow?<End>
Isabella?<End>
?!<End>
So this is Isabella's room...?<End>
I can see inside through the keyhole...<End>
Hey... you know this kid?<End>
Yes...<End>
He was peeping into your room...
shall I just dump him somewhere?<End>
No! You mustn't!<End>
...Well, if you say so.
<End>
He's lucky it was me who spotted him
and not Wolf, that's all.<End>
Ughh! My head's pounding...<End>
Where am I...?<End>
Right... I was peeking into Isabella's
room and I got knocked out...<End>
So... is this Isabella's room? <End>
Isabella and a guy, smiling happily...<End>
This guy... he looks familiar... <End>
So you're awake.<End>
...<End>
You shouldn't peek into people's rooms.<End>
Sorry...<End>
I'm not angry or anything.
Just, don't do it again.<End>
Something much worse could happen
to you...<End>
You're Emma's friend, right?<End>
What about Emma?<End>
It's not like I knew her well or
anything... Just... she took a liking to
my singing...<End>
I see.<End>
You're looking for her?<End>
Yes.<End>
But I just don't know what was going on
in her head...<End>
I think I sort of understand how she
was feeling.<End>
She reminds me of me, two years ago...<End>
...<End>
Losing the will to live... not able to ask
anyone for help... feeling so alone...<End>
That photo's from two years ago.
I was living in Denver then.<End>
Who's the guy in the photo with you?<End>
He was my husband.<End>
Was?<End>
He died. Two years ago, in a car
accident.<End>
How come you're living in this town?<End>
Doesn't he resemble someone?
My husband.<End>
Dennis
Emma
Wolf<End>
He looks like Dennis, maybe?<End>
...
How come you mention Dennis? I've got
nothing to do with him at all.<End>
But you know Dennis?<End>
...

Well, yes... he's the big man in this town.<End>
He often comes to the bar, too...<End>
So you really can't guess?<End>
I've got nothing to do with Dennis!<End>
He looks like... Emma?
<End>
...I understand you're worried about
Emma, but she and I weren't that
closely involved.<End>
Don't go suspecting me.<End>
So you really can't guess?<End>
He looks a bit like Wolf.
Are they brothers or something?<End>
That's right. He was Wolf's younger
brother.<End>
Two years ago, after I lost my husband,
I was all alone. Wolf's the one who
saved me...<End>
Gave me somewhere to perform my
songs... <End>
You mean Eternal?<End>
That's the name Emma gave it.
It originally didn't have a name.<End>
Emma named it?<End>
Two years ago, I was in the car with my
husband when we had the accident.
But I was the only one who survived.<End>
At that moment, I too temporarily died.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
I wonder if I had a post-death
experience. Medically speaking, I was
definitely dead.<End>
The dream I had, while I was at the
hospital, unconscious...<End>
I was enveloped in a brilliant white
light... and when I listened closely, I
could hear a beautiful melody...<End>
I wrote Eternal using that melody, the
one I heard in my dream...<End>
when I told this story to Emma,
she cried... and she said...<End>
"That's so wonderful..."<End>
she said... "It makes me feel like I'm in a
world where there's no need to worry
about life or death ever again."<End>
And that's when she named the song
"Eternal".<End>
I liked the meaning of the word, so I
changed the lyrics slightly to
incorporate it.<End>
I see...<End>
Stop it...<End>
Huh?<End>
Stop it! Please! I'm begging you, make
that noise stop!<End>
...<End>
It was a huge mistake to ever
trust him...<End>
...Isabella?<End>
Could you please just go home?<End>
...<End>
Don't come here again...<End>
But...<End>
No! You mustn't!
I'm saying this for your own good...<End>
...<End>
Can I come in?<End>
I told you not to come here again.<End>
...<End>
It's open.<End>
Emma wrote about you in her diary.<End>
What did she say?<End>
She said you need help.<End>
...<End>
Perhaps I could help you.<End>
Don't talk so foolish! What could
YOU possibly do to help?!<End>
...<End>
I'm sorry...

But...<End>
It's all right. Everything's the same as
normal.<End>
Yes...

All right.<End>
I have no freedom...

it's just the same as if I was
imprisoned...<End>
Isabella...<End>
I made a deal with the devil in exchange
for some relief from my loneliness...<End>
When you make a deal with the devil,
the devil always consumes you in the
end...<End>
I want to be alone...<End>
...<End>
Please... don't bother about me
anymore...<End>
You seem to be suffering a lot.<End>
I want to help you.<End>
Don't you get it?! A boy like you shouldn't
ever set foot in a world like this...<End>
And she shouldn't have, either...<End>
Please, speak to me... Isabella...<End>
...

Foolish child...<End>
Thank you...
<End>
But... thank you for caring.<End>
He's going to come by here soon...
You need to leave.<End>
But...<End>
It's all right.
I'll take care of myself somehow...<End>
Please...
Just listen to me...<End>
All right.<End>
Wait!<End>
Here...
<End>
My song.
<End>
I wonder why Emma liked the song
so much...
anyway, have a listen.<End>
I don't know if there's any connection
between the song and her
disappearance, but...<End>
Thank you.<End>
I still haven't asked your name.<End>
It's Matthew.<End>
Matthew... that's a nice name.<End>
Thank you, Matthew.
It's been so long since I've felt any
human kindness...<End>
You got the
Tape of Eternal<End>
...<End>
I don't know what's troubling you,
but I can't just leave you alone...<End>
...

Thank you.<End>
I still haven't asked your name.<End>
It's Matthew.<End>
Matthew... that's a nice name.<End>
Matthew, thanks for the other night.<End>
Your kindness has restored some of
my humanity.<End>
Don't worry, I can take care of myself
somehow.<End>
I've included my song with this letter.
I wonder why Emma liked the song so
much... anyway, have a listen.<End>
I don't know if there's any connection
between the song and her
disappearance, but...<End>
Also, don't come to my place again.<End>
Matthew... it's been so long since I've
felt any human kindness...<End>
Isabella...<End>
Matthew, I'm all right.
Please just go home now.<End>
I'll contact you.<End>
Okay...<End>
No good, it's too dark to see.<End>
Is this Isabella's room?<End>
?!<End>
What happened?<End>
This is the place.
Let's hurry this up.<End>
I wonder where this cabin is?<End>
The forest? No, it's
not... <End>
Wait!<End>
What?<End>
Have you seen Isabella recently?<End>
What? Are you still chasing after that
lady?<End>
It's not like that.<End>
Now you mention it, I haven't seen her
recently. No one's been going in or out
of her place. <End>
I heard she's suffering from exhaustion.
Her apartment's locked...<End>
If you're worried about her, why not
sneak into her apartment?<End>
How?<End>
This building's old. Maybe you can get in
through the air duct in the empty room
next door?<End>
The air duct? Is it ok for me to do that?<End>
Of course not.<End>
...<End>
If you're worried about that lady,
why not sneak into her apartment?<End>
Sneak in, eh?<End>
Please...

Make that noise stop!<End>
Please, just go home...
And don't come by here again...<End>
None of your business what I'm doing!
Get lost!<End>
What do you want here?
You don't want to LIVE here, do you?!<End>
Hmm? You got some business here?
This room's not for rent!
Move along, now.<End>
What are you peeping at?
None of your business what I do!<End>
Who the hell are you?
Quit loitering! Don't make me chase you
outta here!<End>
I don't feel like talkin'!
You're pissin' me off, kid!<End>
What, whaaat?!
You gonna follow me to the potty, too?!<End>
What are you looking at?!
You came to laugh at me?<End>
What, whaaat?!
This place ain't got nothing to do with you!
Get out!<End>
You've got some nerve, snooping around
here.
Get out.<End>
Having fun snooping around here?
Get the hell out.<End>
