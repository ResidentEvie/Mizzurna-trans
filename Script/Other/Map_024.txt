Samuel Grouver (39)<End>
Chief doctor at Grouver Hospital.
He treated Kathy when she was
initially brought in.<End>
He has a difficult personality,
and occasionally seems untrustworthy.<End>
Is this a letter?
It's been opened.<End>
Huh...
Won't open.<End>
I shall pray for you. The answer to any
trouble lies in prayer.
.
.
.Amen.<End>
Rustle, rustle...<End>
Everyone, silence please.<End>
So are we talking about a murder here?<End>
It's a possibility.<End>
The thing is, the choke marks on her
neck weren't the direct cause of death.<End>
What was the cause, then?<End>
To put it simply, she died of shock.<End>
Shock?
 Wouldn't you die of shock at the
moment of the incident?<End>
Kathy was in a weakened state...<End>
We don't know the cause, but there was
something that sparked her memory...
a flashback of being attacked.<End>
By the bear?<End>
Like I've said many times, we can't be
certain it was a bear.<End>
But the wounds were definitely caused
by an animal.<End>
Everyone, the main points here are that
Kathy was attacked by an animal
in the forest.<End>
Now Emma, the mayor's daughter,
is missing.<End>
We've decided to search Barrows
Forest, and we would appreciate
everyone's help and assistance.<End>
All men please convene at the forest
hut this afternoon at 3:30pm.
It should be safe until it gets dark. <End>
Mr. Mayor...?<End>
Right now my daughter may be suffering
somewhere.<End>
Everyone...<End>
...<End>
Sob... sniffle...
I know... 
I know that... Emma is alive...<End>
Waaaaah!<$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><End>
Everyone, listen up.<End>
According to Doctor Samuel, It's highly
likely that Kathy has been attacked by
a bear.<End>
Also...<End>
it's possible there may be a killer
involved, unthinkable as it is.<End>
Keep your children inside after dark.<End>
That is all.<End>
Choke  marks on her neck?!<End>
Is that what  Morgan meant by
"suspicious"...?<End>
Matthew.
The meeting's about to start.
Sorry, but could you step outside?<End>
I can hear everyone talking, but the
door's locked and I can't go in.<End>
Huh, it won't open.<End>
I wonder what's going on inside?<End>
Isn't there any way I can see what's
going on?<End>
...<End>
Dear holy father...<End>
Grant the child peaceful sleep...<End>
Lord... please forgive the sinful child...
and please forgive me...<End>
Father Barton.<End>
I was confessing my sins to the lord.<End>
By child do you mean Kathy?<End>
Yes.<End>
We humans live under the burden of our
own sins. By dying, she has been
released from this burden,<New>
and will never sin again.<End>
When I think of it that way,
it seems like it was a blessing she died.<End>
How can you say that?!<End>
From our birth until our death, we must
choose our own way to live.<End>
To live purely, or to rack up sins.<End>
That child...<End>
No... never mind... it's too complicated
for you.<End>
Okay...<End>
Hmm? Those guys...<End>
They're the guys who beat up
Father Barton outside the bar!<End>
Yes.<End>
Why are those guys here?<End>
They have finally seen God's light.
It is a true wonder.<End>
But...
I can't believe this...<End>
Matthew. The young people have taken
responsibility for their actions.<End>
Hey! What the hell? You just felt like
coming here to pray?<End>
...<End>
N-Not really...<End>
You'd understand if you learned to live
decently, too.<End>
Not that I could persuade you.<End>
What are you talking about?<End>
Matthew, it is all right.
<End>
All that matters is that they are here
now.<End>
...<End>
Hey! Let's leave, already.<End>
Oh... yeah...<End>
What's with those guys?<End>
Winona!<End>
No one around, huh...<End>
What is this?<End>
There's a date and signature.<End>
December 24th, Kathy Flannery?!<End>
Maybe this is Kathy's final message!<End>
"I hope that whoever reads this letter
will understand just a little of how I'm
feeling."<End>
"Today, the most horrible thing
of my whole life happened to me."<End>
"My father strangled me and tried
to kill me."<End>
"Someone, please, tell me. Was it so
wrong for me to have gone against
my father's wishes?"<End>
"The image of my father's face as he
was choking me is burned into my mind."<End>
"I feel like nothing in life has any
meaning to me anymore.
I'll never again..."<End>
"Tonight, I'm going to the forest with
Emma."<End>
"Even if nothing good happens, I
don't even care anymore."<End>
"No matter what happens, I can't imagine
anything could be more terrifying than
what I felt in that moment..."<End>
Father Barton strangled her...<End>
The ink's all splotched... did she
write this while crying? <End>
Ugh...<End>
Where am I...?<End>
Are we awake?<End>
Father Barton?<End>
Ugh... I'm tied up...<End>
Father Barton!
Why have you done this...?<End>
...<End>
Father...?<End>
Did you read Kathy's letter?<End>
Yes... it said you choked her.<End>
She was a sinful child...<End>
She befouled the life she should have
spent walking alongside God by
using drugs.<New>
She went against my guidance.<End>
But, even so!<End>
On the night of the 23rd, I saw them
all at the motel, out of their minds
on drugs.<End>
That's when I received my holy orders.
Telling me not to let them get away
with it.<End>
No! Even if I forgave them,
God never would!<End>
Isn't it your job to hear and forgive
people's confessions? So why did
you do such a horrible thing?!<End>
You're trying to preach to me?<End>
...<End>
That's what I intended to do, at first...<End>
But that child gave herself up to the
devil!<End>
Do you understand?!
She went against not only me,
but God himself!<End>
The devil?! What devil?!
<End>
What about Emma?
Did you try to kill her, too?!<End>
...<End>
In her letter, Kathy said she couldn't
stop thinking about your face as you
choked her...<End>
You weren't doing God's work then,
were you? YOU were the devil himself!<End>
Shut up!<End>
Who gives a crap about God's word?! 
Does it tell us to live like Kathy,
a prisoner in her own life?!<End>
Uhh...<End>
It's just as you say. I have sinned, again.
<End>
I forgot myself in my anger.
I strangled her.<End>
But I couldn't kill her...<End>
...<End>
Our way of thinking has been shaped by
a long history of morality.<End>
But even so, are you not going to act
based on emotion? Emotion rules us,
whether we want it to or not.<End>
But, if we only act based on our
emotions,<End>
then all we are is animals who eat
and breed.<End>
God is morality. And morality is God... <End>
Father Bar-<End>
Father Barton...<End>
I have to get out of here somehow...<End>
This rope... if I just wriggle a little
more, I can get it off!<End>
Just a bit more...<End>
...Free!<End>
But...
Where am I, anyway?<End>
Matthew!<End>
Winona! Thank god! You were all right...<End>
I just got here... has something
happened?<End>
Yeah...<End>
On the night of the 23rd, it seems that
Kathy rented a room at the motel.
Do you know anything about that?<End>
?!<End>
Kathy...? It's true that she did come
home late on the 23rd... She was at the
motel...<End>
Yes, and it seems that she didn't
check out.<End>
I thought you might have the key to her
room, or something?<End>
I see...
<End>
Wait here a moment.<End>
This key was in Kathy's bedroom.<End>
I didn't know what it was for, but
it's got the number 3 on it.
It must be a motel key.<End>
No doubt about it. I'll just borrow this.
The old fellow at the motel asked if I
could return it.<End>
Hold on a moment.
You'll need money, to check out.<End>
Please, take this.<End>
I don't think that's necessary. <End>
I insist. It's for your trouble.<End>
All right.<End>
You got the

Motel Key<End>
May I trouble you for a donation to the
church?<End>
Oh, thank you. I've been here a long time,
but I've never known such a good,
upstanding young man like yourself.<End>
A long time? So, do you know about the
incident that happened here 40
years ago?<End>
40 years ago? You mean Cougar?
Yes, I know it well. He lived in the
basement of this church.<End>
In the basement?
Is that where he did the ritual?<End>
No, it happened in front of the big tree
in Barrows Forest. That's where
he did it. <End>
The big tree? That's where Cohen found
Kathy.<End>
Way back, I heard this from the priest.
He said that the big tree gives the power
of life.<New>
It was worshipped by the indigenous
tribespeople.<End>
Kathy, and  the incident from 40 years
ago...  it can't be a coincidence...
The big tree in the forest, huh...<End>
In front of the tree... he... Young man,
are you listening to me?<End>
Huh?! Sorry! Um, are there any
documents or anything from Cougar's
research into the ritual in this church?<End>
Father Barton burned everything long
ago.<End>
Thank you very much.<End>
Yep, yep.
Can't be helped.<End>
Still so young...<End>
?! James...<End>
Hnn?
...Matthew?<End>
What are you doing here?<End>
I thought there might still be some clues
here from when Cougar lived here.<End>
Who would have thought I'd find
something like this here.<End>
What is it?<End>
This is a painting of the Death Journey
Ritual. Cougar probably painted it. <End>
What's this... round thing?<End>
It's the full moon.
And underneath is the dead person.<End>
Yes... so, a full moon is necessary
 in order  for the dead to reawaken...?<End>
A full moon... wasn't there a full moon
on the 24th?<End>
Yes. And the next one will be the night
of the 31st.<End>
The 31st...<End>
Aren't there any other clues?<End>
No papers left at all. I heard Father
Barton burned them all.<End>
I guess he couldn't erase this.<End>
Guess not.<End>
I'm going now. See you.<End>
The meeting's about to start.
Only adults are allowed to attend.<End>
I think there's something more serious
to be discussed than hunting bears.
I'll tell you all about it later.<New>
Hadn't you better leave the church now?<End>
Whether Emma and Kathy were
together or not... right now, it's more
important to locate that bear.<End>
You don't believe in God, do you, Matthew.
I mean, I don't really, either. But
humans... need to believe in something.<New>
Whether it's God, or something else.<End>
I come every day to pray.
Today was Kathy's funeral, wasn't it?
I just had to pray.<End>
You pray too, Matthew.
If we all pray hard for Emma's safety,
surely God will hear us.<End>
Matthew...
Will you pray, too?
For poor Kathy...<End>
Matthew, let's pray together.
For the poor girl's soul...<End>
The depravity of young people today
shocks me to my core.
I cannot accept it.<End>
Did you know, Matthew? Humans are
inherently sinful creatures. It is only
through prayer that we can be cleansed.<End>
Have you noticed, Matthew? How the
souls of today's young are so corrupt?
They should follow the righteous path...<End>
Let us pray for those poor, unfortunate
souls...
So that they may be shown the right way.<End>
Have you noticed, Matthew? How many
walk amongst us with tainted souls?
Let us pray to the Lord to cleanse them.<End>
Matthew...
Do you try to follow the path of
righteousness?<End>
Matthew, looking at your young face
reminds me of Kathy...
What a terrible tragedy...<End>
Matthew, let us pray.
For the sinners to return to the rightful
path...<End>
Are you living a life free from sin?
Sinful deeds lead to a tainted soul,
you know.<End>
Those who have fallen from God's
graces... I can not turn my back on them.
I must grant them my mercy...<End>
Matthew...
Humans are such sinful creatures.
Let us pray, that sin does not take us.<End>
Don't you find that this world is full of
sinners?
At this rate, the world will be damned...<End>
It's almost the end of this year.
So many unhappy things have happened.
It is truly awful...<End>
The meeting's about to start, you know.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you attend.<End>
Hmm...
So many townsfolk have showed up.<End>
Well, it's a terrible thing that's
happened, in our peaceful little town.<End>
Matthew, have you come to pray?
Please, pray for my Emma, too...<End>
Oh, Emma...
What are you doing right now? I hope
nothing horrible is happening to you...<End>
Oh, Lord...
Save my Emma...
Please... heal her pain...<End>
Oh, Emma...
What is happening to you right now?
Are you... cold, where you are?<New>
I hope you're not suffering...
I'd swap places with you if only I could...<End>
I'm just here doing research.
There's something I'd like to check out.
<End>
Dear Lord...
...Amen.<End>
It's getting quite late...<End>
Oh, right, okay.<End>
Let us hope we all welcome the new
year safely.<End>
Let's pray for that girl, Kathy, too.<End>
Please, next year, give me a human
girlfriend...
...mumble mumble.<End>
You pray, too.
For those we've lost this Christmas...<End>
