Emma should be here... 
in this forest...<End>
Is anyone there?
I'm about to close this forest off!<End>
Civilians should leave immediately!<End>
?<End>
"Barrows Forest"

Be kind to nature.<End>
It is forbidden to pass this point,
by order of the police.
Morgan Stein<End>
Bear slashes...
This is where it got Kathy.
Was Emma here, too?<End>
I need a weapon!<End>
Shells!<End>
Damn... it won't open!<End>
<End>
<End>
<End>
<End>
No shells! Where are the shells?<End>
I killed it...<End>
Hmm? Something's caught in its paw.<End>
What's this?
It's wrapped around its claws...<End>
This... is the bear that attacked Kathy.<End>
Did it also attack...
...No, I'm not gonna think about that.<End>
? I can't quite get it...<End>
?! Ah, got it!<End>
What's that?<End>
A necklace?<End>
Weird... isn't this a native tribal
artefact?<End>
Was this Kathy's? Or Emma's?<End>
I don't think it's Emma's... she always
hated necklaces.<End>
Can't be hers...<End>
This must have been bothering the bear.<End>
Hmm... I'd better take that. I'll ask
Barton if it was Kathy's.<End>
You wanna go in? Haven't you heard?
The forest's off-limits.
There's a bear in there, you know.<End>
Hahhh...
I hate the cold... why can't someone else
take my place?<End>
You again?
I'm not gonna let you in, you know.<End>
Mornings are so cold...
I need to take a leak soon...
Ugh... not again...<End>
Nope, can't hold it...
You! The forest's off-limits!
Please leave at once!<End>
It's freezing.
Ugh! Again?!
Man, why'd I need to pee so bad?<End>
Hey! Stupid kid!
Can't relax my guard for one second!
No means no!!!<End>
Well, no one's around anyway, so...<End>
Hey! You!<End>
We don't know what's in these woods.
You be careful.<End>
Matthew...
Don't go too far away.<End>
Keep your instincts sharp.
Move slowly, don't make any sudden
movements.<End>
We don't have time for sightseeing,
Matthew. <End>
...<End>
Ugh... I'm exhausted...<End>
I wonder if the two of them performed
the "Death Journey Ritual" here.<End>
If so, that would mean Emma knew how
to perform it.<End>
Eternal life... ridiculous.<End>
Hmm, come to think of it, Cohen said the
forest felt strange that day. I wonder if
that has anything to do with the ritual...<End>
That wound on the back of your neck!<End>
Yes, that's where the bear slashed me. 
That's when I lost sight of Emma.<End>
I never thought that Wolf of all people
would betray me. Look how I've suffered
due to that oversight.<End>
Emma!<End>
Run into the cabin!<End>
This is bad...
The bear's gonna come in any second...<End>
Perhaps I'll leave the bear disposal t
Nozz. He seems like the kind of
guy who'll know what to do with it.<End>
So I guess the forest's no longer
off-limits?<End>
Guess so. I'll post a deputy on
sentry duty, but he'll let you pass
freely enough.<End>
I'll stick around here a little longer.
If you're worried about Cohen,
why not go check on him at the hospital?<End>
The forest has been placed off-limits.<End>
Huh? Did something happen in there?<End>
No, it's not that.
But the Sheriff told me to close it off.<End>
What, Morgan said that?
But why close it again?<End>
Maybe another bear's prowling around.<End>
The forest is being checked.
Can't let kids in here.<End>
You still haven't found Emma?<End>
No news yet.<End>
I see...
<End>
How long will the forest check be
going on?<End>
It's too dangerous after dark.
Head to the department around 5.
The results should be ready then.<End>
Okay.<End>
Leave this to us!<End>
Ouch! Damage 1.<End>
Oof! Damage 2.<End>
Guh! Damage 3.<End>
Argh! Bear Power Up 1.<End>
Grawrgh! Bear Power Up 2.<End>
Stop it! ...it's dead.<End>
Serves it right! I won!<End>
Matthew, the forest is off-limits.<End>
Are you searching it now?<End>
Yeah.<End>
Let me join the search.<End>
I can't do that. The bear might be
around. I can't let a child be exposed
to such danger.<End>
Matthew...
I know how you feel, but leave this to us.<End>
Hmm...
Nozz is the bear expert here.<End>
You did good, Matthew!
I've seen you in a new light.<End>
Cohen said the forest felt bad somehow.
He knows more about the forest than
anyone.<End>
The last evening in the forest this year...
It feels strange somehow...<End>
There's something odd about the forest.
You should ask Cohen about it.<End>
The last evening in the forest this year...
Feels ominous.
I hope nothing bad is going to happen...<End>
You came here without a weapon?
No no, no bear hunting. It's still too
dangerous.<End>
Kids shouldn't be walking around here
at this time of night.
The case still hasn't been solved.<End>
If you wanna hunt bears, wait until
everything's been sorted out. I still
think there's something in the forest...<End>
Kids shouldn't be walking around here.
If you wanna play in the forest, wait
until everything's been sorted out.<End>
It's my duty to patrol the forest.
Everything that happens in here is my
responsibility.<End>
I'm worried about the forest.
I have to patrol.<End>
You shouldn't come to the forest at this
time of night.
Do you understand me?<End>
This tree...
Are you interested in it, Matthew?<End>
I have to patrol.
Everything that happens in here is my
responsibility.<End>
Is this tree the cause of everything...?
...Ignore me. Just talking to myself.
Don't pay any attention.<End>
Matthew...
Do you get any vibes from this tree?<End>
This tree knows what happened.
It knows everything that happened
here...<End>
Who knows what this tree's seen?
Years of silent watch...<End>
What's going to happen in this forest in
years to come?
It concerns me deeply...<End>
...<End>
