Cohen?!<End>
Cohen!<End>
It's no good, it's locked!<End>
Can't I bust it open somehow?<End>
I thought I heard a sound of something
falling upstairs...
Is someone up there?<End>
Is there something I can use in here?
Huh?<End>
A crowbar!

I can break the lock with this!<End>
No good...
It won't open...<End>
It opened!<End>
Is this the envelope Cohen was talking
about?<End>
US Military... the top sheet reads
"Project Mizzurna"...<End>
Mizzurna...<End>
You got
Cohen's Envelope<End>
Something to drink?<End>
No, I'm fine.<End>
Before we talk about this morning,
let me tell you about the forest
last night.<End>
I went out there like I do every night, 
but this time things felt strange.<End>
There was no wind at all, and it was so
silent I felt creeped out.
<End>
Then, around 12pm, a strong wind
started to blow out of nowhere.
Then strange clouds started to roll<New>
over the full moon.<End>
And that's unusual?<End>
I've lived here for a while now, but the
forest last night was extremely
strange.<End>
Then, I woke up with my heart pounding
all of a sudden,
 and I headed off to
the forest...<End>
Then you found Kathy collapsed.<End>
Mm-hmm.<End>
Was Emma with her, though?<End>
I found Kathy in front of a big tree.
And there were signs that someone had
set a fire nearby.<End>
A fire?

So Kathy wasn't there alone?<End>
It would seem not.<End>
Perhaps Kathy met someone in the
forest, then was attacked by a bear.<End>
If the two of them were together last
night,<Unk70> then what did they go to the forest
for in the first place?<End>
Cohen?!<End>
...<End>
Upstairs?<End>
It's locked...<End>
!!!<End>
Cohen!
Wake up!<End>
I have to discuss something with Cohen.
Come back later.<End>
