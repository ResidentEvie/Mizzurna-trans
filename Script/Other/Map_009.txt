No, no no!
I ain't renting out any boats!<End>
You should just give up. 
Seriously...<End>
You don't wanna go out on that freezing
lake, son.<End>
Winona?<End>
What's wrong?<End>
The last time you saw Emma was by
the lake, wasn't it?<End>
Yeah.<End>
I wonder what Emma was thinking about,
as she was gazing out over the water.<End>
...<End>
I asked Liz to let me back into the school.<End>
What for?<End>
I thought I might find some clues in
Kathy's locker.<End>
Something in there?<End>
Yeah. In the locker, I found this...<End>
A note?

The 24th, with Emma, at the forest?<End>
Yeah...<End>
So they really did meet in the forest
that night.<End>
...<End>
Hmm? 
Looks like something's been
scribbled out. <End>
I'll hold onto this.<End>
Okay.<End>
Matthew...<End>
Emma IS alive, right?<End>
Yeah...<End>
You got

Kathy's Note<End>
I'd like to rent a boat.<End>
A boat? No can do. Not  many customers
this season, so the boats are
undergoing maintenance right now.<End>
Isn't there at least one boat that's
useable?<End>
Nope, can't use any of them. I'm thinking
of quitting boat rental altogether for
the winter season.<End>
But I have to get to the opposite shore.<End>
The opposite shore?!
 What... you, too...?<End>
Nope... 
Sorry, but can't do it.<End>
If you know something about Isabella...<End>
Isabella?

...Look, just accept that I'm not gonna
rent you a boat.<End>
What the hell is that...?<End>
?!
So, you're with them...<End>
Them?

What are you talking about?<End>
Huh?!
So... you're not?<End>
Isabella's on the other side of the lake,
isn't she?!<End>
No...<End>
It's too late, quit bluffing!<End>
Sigh... all right.

Those guys... showed up and told me not
to rent out any boats. 
Man, what a pain...<End>
Rent ME a boat.

I promise it won't get you in any trouble.<End>
I don't think you should go.

Those guys... they seemed pretty
dangerous.<End>
I don't care!

There's no time!<End>
...You can use the boat on the end.<End>
So Emma is alive...<End>
We need to get to Dennis!

He's got Emma too, I know it!<End>
Calm down.

Hudson's on his way to Dennis's now.<End>
Huh. Dead line.<End>
Excuse me.<End>
Yes?<End>
What happened to the guy in the cabin?<End>
There was no one in the cabin.

Seems your guy ran away.<End>
...I see.<End>
Give his description to the deputy.<End>
All right.<End>
What's happened?<End>
Dennis is dead.<End>
Dead?!<End>
Shit!

What the hell is happening to this town?!<End>
What do you mean, he's dead?!
Did someone kill him?<End>
He shot himself with his own gun.

It was suicide.<End>
Suicide?!<End>
I have to get over to Astin Farm.

We'll talk later.<End>
Don't bother me, I'm chilling out here.
You're a distraction.<End>
This is my favourite spot.
The perfect place to relax and enjoy 
some solitude.<End>
Hey, hey! You're interrupting my
"me" time! It took me ages to find the
perfect spot, too!<End>
I love just passing time here alone.
It's the highlight of my day.
Could you leave me alone?<End>
Great place to relax and get some fresh
air.
Don't crowd me, man.<End>
I'm taking a little break.
You gotta give yourself a treat now and
then.<End>
Ahhh!
The perfect place to be alone!<End>
The Emma I always saw wasn't the real
Emma at all.
I wish I'd realised that sooner...<End>
Why didn't Emma talk to me?
I told her... everything...<End>
Emma was all alone...
She had no one to talk to...<End>
I wish I could see Emma...
we could talk about so much...<End>
What?
Don't keep dithering about.<End>
What did you come here for?
Enough with the detective games.<End>
What are you doing?
...Stare all you like, it won't do you any
good.<End>
Welcome!
What'll it be?<End>
We've got the works.
Come take the chill off.<End>
Coffee, right?
Coming right up.<End>
Milk, eh?
Yeah, you look like a milk drinker.<End>
