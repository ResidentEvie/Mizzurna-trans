Matthew...<End>
I thought you had a curfew?<End>
I snuck out...<End>
Something bothering you?<End>
...<End>
Is it Emma?<End>
...The Emma thing has been a shock... <End>
For me, too.<End>
No... I think it's different for me... <End>
In what way?<End>
I always had the feeling that one day
Emma would leave, and go far away...<End>
...<End>
One time Emma brought me along to
Wolves.<End>
To... Wolves?<End>
So the girl Wolf mentioned was Winona?<End>
Emma was wasted...<End>
I was... shocked...
<End>
I tried to take her home, but this creepy
guy was there...
but Emma got rid of him...<End>
Then she said to me... "Winona, this isn't
the place for girls like you..."<End>
Isn't that messed up?<End>
...<End>
That's when I realised... there's another
Emma I don't know...<End>
Though I tried so hard... <End>
Winona...<End>
When we said goodbye that night...
Emma said... "Is it fun, being with me?"
...<End>
And I said... sure...<End>
Then Emma  said... "Would you be sad if I
disappeared?"<End>
...And I said of course... why would you
even ask that...<End>
Then Emma smiled... and said good
night...<End>
...<End>
Winona...<End>
I should have been able to help her...<End>
Don't blame yourself.<End>
...<End>
Probably Emma didn't want to get you
involved in whatever was troubling her.<End>
And she probably couldn't tell you
BECAUSE she cared so much about you.<End>
Thank you, Matthew...<End>
But I wish... she would have talked to
me even so...<End>
Yeah...<End>
Matthew...?<End>
Don't blame yourself.<End>
.<End>
..<End>

...<End>
... Okay.<End>
I guess I showed you my vulnerable
side...<End>
Try to relax a little more. You take on
too much by yourself.<End>
You could be right...<End>
Thank you, for listening to me.<End>
My dad'll be worried about me.
I should head home now.<End>
Matthew, you'll drive me back, won't
you?<End>
Yeah.<End>
They call me the battler, and my hobby is
pounding fools!
I shall teach you the ways of fighting.<End>
Are you all right, old man?<End>
But first, sonny, tell me your name.<End>
Huh?<End>
Come on, your name!<End>
...It's Matthew.<End>
All right Matthew, let's start with the
basics. The direction keys change up
depending on your position.<End>
Press ○ alone for a normal punch.
It's got a pretty short range.
But the key here is speed.<New>
Get in close to your opponent.<End>
Press ○ and forward.
That's an elbow move. It's fast, but it
leaves you open. Don't overuse it.<End>
Press ○ and back.
That's a jab. Speedy, but not that
powerful.<New>
Keep an eye on your opponent's moves.<End>
Press the  × button alone.
That's a normal kick.
Has a wide range, but no speed.<End>
Press × with a directional button.
That's a lightning kick.
It'll send your opponent flying.<New>
use it when you spot an opening.<End>
That's all for the basic moves.
Now we fight.
See if you can take me down!<End>
Now, for the special moves.
Pay close attention, now.<End>
If you can get in two hits in a row, the
third one will become a finishing blow.
It's the most powerful move,<New>
and will floor your opponent.<End>
Press down to squat. You can dodge an
opponent's punch this way. Watch your
opponent's movements closely.<End>
Press back or forward twice in quick
succession to dash or back up.
That'll make you close in, or get some<New>
space between you and your opponent.<End>
If you press ○ while dashing forward,
you'll do a shoulder charge, aka the
Matthew Bomber.<New>
It leaves you open to a counterattack,
though.<End>
All right, that's the end of the lesson.
Now we fight.
See if you can take me down!<End>
Not bad, not bad... now, let us go deeper!<End>
But first, tell me your name, sonny boy.<End>
It's Matthew!
I think I already told you, old man!<End>
Don't think, just feel, Matthew.<End>
Throw a normal punch with ○.
As it connects, press × to kick. As the
kick connects, punch again with  ○.<New>
That's a Matthew Triple.
It's tricky, so practice.<End>
Now, see if you can take me down!<End>
Not bad, not bad. Now, you are ready.
A host of challengers awaits you by the
junkyard.<New>
Will you fight?<End>
(One on One mode)
I'll fight.
I'll pass.<End>
You wish to practice more with me?
I'll spar, old man.
I'm done.<End>
You wish to be taught?
Teach me, Sensei
Uh, no thanks.<End>
Weakling!<End>
You're going to give up?
I'm just warming up!
I can't beat you...<End>
No, no, no!
You have no fire!
You must practice!<End>
You've improved.
But you must read your opponent.
All right, I'll fill up your gas tank.<End>
Heh, strange to see you in the park
alone at night...
Nice and relaxing here, isn't it?<New>
You should head on home.
I'm going to hang out here a while.<End>
You may think this is weird...
But I find the park relaxing at night.
Matthew, there's a curfew.<New>
Head on home.<End>
The park is so tranquil.
I wish there were more moments
like this.<End>
I think about all kinds of things here.
I'll stay here a while longer.
It's late, you head home, Matthew.<End>
The park is where I can relax the most.
Do you have a special place too, Matthew?<End>
Don't worry people.
Head home, don't get into trouble.<End>
Sorry, I don't feel like talking.
Can you leave me alone?<End>
I find it soothing, being here alone.
Sigh...
Everything is so awful...<End>
I always feel so relaxed here....
How long...
How long can I carry on like this?<End>
Hmm...
Sure is cold.<End>
Hey, hey...
Being late for a date, isn't that super
messed up?<End>
Sigh...
I'm useless...
I wish I was stronger...<End>
So cold...
Gets into the bones...
Brrrr!<End>
Oh, I'm fine...
Just trying to think how we can find
Emma...<End>
I only ever saw the surface of Emma...<End>
Emma...
I wish I could have been there for you...
I was no help to her... none at all...<End>
Why didn't Emma ever say anything to
me...
It makes me feel so... alone...<End>
Thank you.
You and Emma... were a good match.<End>
You were in my dream last night,
Matthew.
But I forgot the details...<End>
Sometimes, I like to be alone.
Does that surprise you?<End>
...<End>
Sonny boy, do you know who I am?<End>
No idea.
You're Old Man Perry.<End>
