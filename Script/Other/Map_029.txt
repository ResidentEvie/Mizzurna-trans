James Loloma

Hmm? Something stuck in here...<End>
△××△ ...
A phone number?<End>
It says "James Loloma"...
.
..This is James's locker.<End>
You can't come back here.<End>
What's this?<End>
The head doctor lent it to me. He said he
thought I might be bored. But he hasn't
got any tapes, so he put the radio on.<End>
It's the hospital noticeboard.<End>
Kathy's in room 201.
Must be on the second floor.
The room on the left side.<End>
It says Kathy's in room 201, so that's
the second floor.<End>
No time for sightseeing.
Let's hurry to Kathy's room.<End>
Too much is happening, it's too
confusing...
I'd better follow Morgan.<End>
Isabella's in here, but...
She's in no condition to have visitors.<End>
Apparently, in a stable condition...
What on earth has Cohen been up to?<End>
Are you busy right now?<End>
Not really.
You want to ask me something about
Emma?<End>
"Nothing exists, and if it did, no one can
be aware of it, and if anyone was aware
of it, they could not communicate it to<New>
others."
This was written in a book I
think Emma was reading...<End>
You're quite the detective.
That sounds like Emma all right. <End>
Don't mock me, please.<End>
All right, all right. That's a quote from
Gorgias, an ancient philosopher. I think it
expresses Emma's mental state well.<End>
It's sad. It sounds like being all alone,
trapped in your own world, unable to
escape.<End>
There was a side of Emma you never
knew. But then again, I think Emma's
taken a step into territory I doubt most<New>
people could understand.<End>
Are you going to the bar?<End>
You mean Wolves? I'm underage.<End>
Emma often went there.<End>
What?!<End>
Wolves is where I got to know Emma in
the first place. It seems she caused a
bit of trouble there, though. Got a bit<New>
of a name for herself.<End>
I don't believe it...<End>
You only knew one side of her. You might
see the other side if you come.
Maybe even the key to finding her.<End>
Have you heard of "Eternal"?<End>
Eternal?!<End>
What? What's this Eternal?<End>
Apparently it's a song Emma often
played.<End>
A song...<End>
It's a really beautiful song.
Kind of... ethereal.<End>
So Emma liked that song?<End>
I'm asking you...<End>
Go to the bar tonight.
You might hear that song.<End>
The... bar?<End>
Yeah, around 10pm.<End>
What's this about?<End>
You'll find out if you go.<End>
Do you know where Sheriff Morgan
went?<End>
He said he was going back to the
department.<End>
Oh, okay...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
Miss Holden! Why are you here?<End>
Why not? What's wrong with a
granddaughter visiting her sick granny?<End>
Granddaughter? Then...<End>
Yes, this is my grandmother.<End>
I see...<End>
If this is your student, doesn't that
mean he's in the same grade as Emma?<End>
You know Emma?<End>
Emma used to visit granny.<End>
Emma was a nice girl. Poor thing.<End>
It's not like she's dead.<End>
That's right, granny, she's not. <End>
I see, I see.<End>
Did Emma visit often?<End>
Yes, Emma had an interest in hearing
granny's tales of the olden days.<End>
Tales of the olden days?<End>
Not nice tales for the telling.<End>
...<End>
Truly, they're not.<End>
I see...<End>
Maybe I'll tell you... if you come and see
me sometimes.<End>
Granny, don't start that again...<End>
Come in!<End>
Oh, there you are.<End>
Morgan? What are you doing here?<End>
Samuel asked me to come.
I just got here.<End>
Why?<End>
I explained about the drugs, right?<End>
Yes. You said Matthew asked you to
identify them.<End>
Well, I checked them out...
don't be shocked, now...<End>
Just spit it out.<End>
Whoever takes that drug will 
experience a powerful hallucinogenic
trip.<End>
?!<End>
Hey! What's the meaning of this?<End>
I could explain, but I doubt you'd get it.
It's "Epoch", a drug popular on the west
coast in the latter half of the sixties.<End>
What I want to know is what something
like that is doing here!<End>
Ask Matthew.
I want to know myself, actually.<End>
Matthew! Where did you get this?!<End>
Well...<End>
I see...<End>
What the hell... this Epoch... in this town!<End>
...<End>
I can't believe it... What the hell is going
on... This is Mizzurna Falls, for crying
out loud!<End>
Looks like Kathy and Emma were into
some deep stuff. I guess we're not
talking about bears anymore.<End>
I bet it was Mel's! Then he needed
money, so he robbed the diner!<End>
Yes, his behaviour is all starting to
make sense now. Why he stole
Emma's diary, why he robbed the diner...<End>
Let's just arrest Mel!<End>
I can't believe this is how Kathy and
Emma were linked...<End>
Is Isabella in this room?<End>
Yes, but she's still very ill.<End>
I see...<End>
How's Isabella's condition?<End>
Relax. She's still unconscious, due to
blood loss. But as we've removed the
bullet, there should be no complications.<End>
That's a relief... How much longer
should she be out?<End>
Hmm, a few hours at the least. At most,
a few days. It's hard to tell.
Still, time will reveal all.<End>
?! From downstairs!<End>
?! Isabella!<End>
Mmmph mmph!<End>
Thank god, are you all right?<End>
?! Mmmph!!!<End>
?!<End>
Ughh...<End>
Jesus, what a pain in the ass.
How many of you people do I have to
kill?<End>
Bonehead! You're the one who...<End>
No, no. Don't move.<End>
...<End>
Sorry about this, kid, but you're about
to be dead.<End>
Unlike with Dennis, I don't have time
to make it look like a suicide.<End>
Dennis! Then you're the one who killed
him...!<End>
Enough talk.<End>
?! ...Ugh...<End>
James!<End>
You! You asshole!<End>
Shit!<End>
Wait!<End>
Matthew, don't follow him!
We have to focus on Isabella.<End>
Isabella, are you all right?<End>
*gasp* *gasp*

Matthew...<End>
James, let's take her back to her room.<End>
Emma's going to be killed!<End>
?!<End>
Emma?!<End>
Matthew... it was Wolf, controlling
everything from the shadows... he's the
one who's been keeping Emma hostage...<End>
Wolf... has been hiding Emma all this
time?<End>
He takes women he likes and makes
them his slaves... I was the same...<End>
And Emma knew that Wolf was
dealing Epoch!<End>
Emma knew about Wolf?<End>
I... introduced her to Wolf.
It's all my fault...<End>
...<End>
He said he's going to kill her tonight at
Astin Farm...<End>
...that it's too dangerous to keep her
alive any longer...<End>
Ugh...<End>
Isabella!<End>
It's all right... never mind me...
you have to save Emma! If you don't
hurry...<End>
You said Astin Farm, right?<End>
Matthew, let's take my car.<End>
All right.<End>
Hurry!<End>
Excuse me... is the head nurse here?<End>
Yes, that's me... do you need something?<End>
Were you the one in the room with
Kathy?<End>
Yes. Poor child...<End>
Doctor Samuel said that Kathy's cause of
death was shock caused by some
sudden catalyst.<End>
A catalyst... that could be true.<End>
Do you have any idea what it could have
been?<End>
It was right when Father Barton
entered. I leaned in to Kathy, and I
said...<End>
"Kathy, don't worry... Father Barton has
come for you..."<End>
And then Kathy's eyes rolled over
towards the Father, and I thought...
everything was going to be all right... <End>
But...?<End>
Just when I started to relax, Kathy
screamed...<End>
...<End>
I wonder if seeing him was too much of...
a relief... for her...<End>
Anyway, in the end things took a tragic
turn...<End>
Where is Kathy's body?<End>
It's in operating room 2 in the basement.
There's a lot of examinations they
needed to do, so she'll be resting there<New>
until her funeral.<End>
When is the funeral?<End>
I don't know... I haven't heard yet. <End>
When is Kathy's funeral going to be held?<End>
Her funeral? That's up to Barton
to decide.
I've already signed off on the body.<End>
I see...<End>
What happens if you take Epoch?<End>
Hmm, let's see. Small hills start to look
like mountains... the sky starts to feel
incredibly close... you feel touched,<New>
by the divine force of nature.<End>
...Is that bad?<End>
Listen. That's the best case scenario
for taking Epoch. But it doesn't
always have the same effects.<End>
So what if it's a bad trip?<End>
You see the devil. Everything around you
seems to be trying to devour you. And by
the end, you doubt your own existence.<End>
...<End>
Well, I've never taken it myself. And it's
not like the effects are always the same
each time. Anyway, it lets you<New>
experience a world that you'd never
normally be able to.<End>
Is Dennis's body here?<End>
Yes, in the basement.<End>
I heard he committed suicide with his
own gun.<End>
Yes. He died instantly.<End>
And it was definitely a suicide?<End>
It's not my job to determine that.
All I know is, that bullet blew his brains
out. Plus, we found a suicide note.<New>
So there can't be any doubt.<End>
I see...<End>
How's Isabella's condition?<End>
She's still not regained consciousness.<End>
Will she really be all right?<End>
She'll be fine. She'll wake up, don't
worry.<End>
I see.<End>
Still, it's hard to believe that pretty lady
was dealing drugs.<End>
It wasn't really Isabella who was
dealing them. She was just being
used by Dennis.<End>
Hmm.<End>
Still... how did Dennis get hold of the
Epoch?<End>
It's not that complicated.
I doubt it was some huge operation.<End>
Really?<End>
A drug like that, anyone with
pharmacology knowledge could make it.
Dennis probably had an acquaintance<New>
with those kind of skills.<End>
Easy to make, and then to make a lot of
money with, I guess.<End>
Oh Granny, really!
I'm sorry, Matthew...<End>
Haha...<End>
So you heard about Cougar.<End>
Yes...<End>
Don't look so glum. It happened 40 years
ago, after all.<End>
What kind of person was Cougar?<End>
He was an acquaintance of the priest
from back then. He lived at the church
and helped out there.<New>
The priest was Barton's father.<End>
...Cougar was very quiet and
introverted, but otherwise, he was
a normal person.<End>
But deep inside was something none
of us could ever understand.<End>
He used my sister as a tool to
confirm the existence of the ritual.
To get some proof of a divine force.<End>
Matthew, I don't give a damn if there's a
divine force or not. We can't lose track
of reality by obsessing over whether<New>
there's something there or not. Our
lives here on earth are all we have.<End>
Yeah.<End>
But you know... Emma just wouldn't
understand that. Guess what she
said?<New>
"If there's no divine force out there,
then how can there be a me to want
to see it?"<End>
...<End>
Poor child...<End>
The newspaper said that Cougar killed
himself...<End>
Yes. In the end, hunted into a corner,
he chose to do the ritual on himself,
and took his own life.<End>
I was very angry. How dare he take my
sister and then escape punishment
by killing himself.<End>
But ever since he died, the church has
been very good to me. <End>
It sounds like the church was the one
trying to atone for Cougar's crime.<End>
Yes, the church were very helpful with
the murder investigation. In the end, it
seems they were working with the<New>
military on investigating the ritual,
though.<End>
The military were involved, too?<End>
It was too much for the sheriff back
then to handle. This is only a small
town. <End>
Here visiting Cohen?<End>
Yes, seems there's no need for concern.<End>
Samuel said Cohen's suffering from
sleep deprivation.<End>
He's been patrolling the forest a lot
lately. It seems he's concerned about
something...<New>
I'd prefer he worried about his health
a little more.<End>
Why did you ask Cohen to oversee
the forest?<End>
Well... he suggested it.
I didn't really think it was necessary.
But, thanks to him, we found Kathy alive,<New>
and the bear hunt was a success.<End>
That's true.
But, what's in the forest, that needs to
be monitored?<End>
Who knows.
He knows the forest better than anyone.
He must have his reasons.<End>
About this Project Mizzurna...<End>
What about it?<End>
Why is it called Mizzurna, and not
Mizzurna Falls?<End>
It is said that he who does the Death
Journey Ritual shall meet with the
Mizzurna.<End>
The Mizzurna?<End>
In the native language, it means "the
great one" or "the truth". The name of
the project was taken from that.<End>
I see.<End>
Has anyone come to visit her?<End>
A tall man with mean looking eyes came,
but he left after inquiring about
Isabella's progress.<End>
Probably Wolf...<End>
Can't I go in there?<End>
Sorry, the sheriff told me not to let
anyone in.<End>
I see.<End>
She's still resting soundly.
I won't let anyone in.<End>
My body's been a wreck recently.
Guess I'm getting old...<End>
I should probably recharge here a bit.
Thanks for your concern.<End>
Yeah.
I think I'll go to the bathroom.<End>
What are you looking at!
HEY!<End>
Ahh, what a relief.
You should never hold your bladder,
Matthew.<End>
Taking it easy every once in a while like
this isn't a bad idea.<End>
You should get a checkup too, Matthew.<End>
No, no.
Whenever I think about the forest,
I just get so antsy...<End>
What?
I'm in a hurry now, so leave it for later.
HEY!<End>
What are you doing?!
Hey!<End>
Ah...
The older I get, the shorter my fuse
grows. It's no picnic, Matthew.<End>
I've been advised to forget my worries
and just rest.<End>
Who knows what would have happened
to me if you hadn't come running in...<End>
I guess I'm old now, too...
That's all I keep thinking, as I stare at
this hospital ceiling...<End>
Not right now!
Please, later!<End>
Look, I'm embarrassed, here!
HEY!<End>
Just can't squeeze out those last few
drops somehow... That's getting old
for you... You hear me, Matthew?<End>
I'm focusing all my energy on just
recuperating.<End>
Your concern really means a lot to me.
Your kindness is very touching.
I guess I'm old...<End>
Hmm...
Sleepy all of a sudden.
Guess this has been good for me.<End>
It seems I'll be discharged soon.
Thanks.<End>
You've been a big help, Matthew.
I'll treat you to lunch sometime.<End>
Don't pay too much attention to what
Granny says. That sour mouth of hers
is a front for her shyness.<End>
Thank you for coming to visit. Granny's
very bored, cooped up in here. She won't
admit it, but she's happy when you come.<End>
The thing about Granny...
She won't admit it, but I think she loves
it when you visit.<End>
Thanks so much for coming to her
birthday party.
I really appreciate it, Matthew.<End>
You're so kind, Matthew.
Please come and visit Granny again.<End>
Granny seems to have taken a shine to
you. She's actually really shy, that's why
she acts like such a sourpuss.<End>
Granny is... really quite lonely.
I really appreciate you taking the time
to visit her.<End>
I've never known a case like this...
Poor Kathy...<End>
Why go back into that forest?
Well, that's not my job to figure out.<End>
Oh, don't get me wrong, now. I'm not just
here to flirt with the nurses... I have
serious business here. Mumble mumble.<End>
You know... this hospital is really
flourishing. 
Probably down to my skill
and talent.<End>
This job, Matthew...
 Well, it takes it out
of you.
I'm suffering, below the surface.<End>
I'm in the hospital director's office a lot.
If you need me, try checking there.<End>
Man, it's Christmas, and I've had no time
for fun. I bet you've been up to all kinds
of merriment, haven't you?<End>
I know how you feel.
But even you could wind up an
accomplished man one day, like me.<End>
What do you think of my "work mode"?
Don't I look so cool and dashing?
Do I dazzle you? Do I?<End>
Man, I do twice the work of everyone
else. All work and no play makes Sam
a dull boy.<End>
Did the nurses tell you off?
Some of them, man... it's all "don't
loiter", "don't do this", blah blah.<End>
Just between you and me, there's this
old battleaxe of a nurse here... Even I'm
afraid of her. Don't let her catch you.<End>
Did you come to chat up the nurses?
Naughty boy, aren't you?<End>
Man, yesterday was Christmas, and I've
had no time for fun. I bet you've been up
to all kinds of hijinks, haven't you?<End>
What do you think of our nurses?
Anyone special catch your eye?
I can set up an introduction for you.<End>
You probably know this, but... I took over
the head doctor position here from my
father. Inheriting a position like this is<New>
tough, you know.<End>
Oh, right... Anything happens, come see
me for a consultation.
Hmm... yes... oh... ah! Perfectly healthy.<End>
By the way, Matthew...
Just between us boys...
Do you know any... cute girls?<End>
Hey, Matthew. Would you like to hear a
tale of my dashing youth? Okay, next
time. You're in for a treat!<End>
I know, I know! There's a nurse who's
caught your eye, isn't there?
You randy young dog!<End>
You know... when I think back... Yes, I
was around your age... Oh boy, I got
around! Man, those were the days...<End>
You can tell me... I'm sort of a legend
around here, aren't I?
It's not flattery if it's the truth.<End>
Man... I envy the young men today...
Going out at night, having all kinds of
fun... Guess my days of sowing wild oats<New>
are over...<End>
Phew, I need a break before I break
down. I'm so overworked!
Can't you tell?<End>
I can tell from your face, you'll be a
great man someday. Like me.
Right? Right?<End>
I do twice the work of everyone else.
I'm entitled to a moment alone to
ponder... stuff.<End>
Hmm? I don't look that busy?
You judge a book by its cover.
That's a very bad habit.<End>
Heh heh heh. Nurse catch your eye?
I can set up an introduction for you.<End>
I'll show you some snaps of me sometime!
Snaps of me as a young man!
Man, I was so cool.<End>
Man, I wanna go blow off some steam!
With a cute nurse or two...
Know what I mean?<End>
Matthew, if you insist on loitering here,
Nurse Battleaxe will be on your case.
She used to be much cuter in her youth.<End>
I know you're dying to see me at work.
But you're cramping my style.<End>
Man, I wanna go blow off some steam!
With a cute nurse.
Know any cute girls?<End>
Hmm? I don't look that busy?
Shows what you know.
Naive one, aren't you?<End>
Just between us, I was quite the ladies'
man in my youth. I'll teach you a few of
my "techniques" sometime.<End>
Say, Matthew... a word in your ear.
Can you introduce me to a cute broad?
I'll make it worth your while.<End>
Matthew, no blushing. Tell me straight.
You really, really admire me, don't you?<End>
Oh, I see! You wanna sit on this chair?
Like to fantasise about running a big
hospital?<End>
Let me tell you something. When I was a
kid, I played hard and I studied hard.
That's what got me where I am today.<End>
I envy you. You get to run around at
night with whatever filly you choose.
Me? I have to work.<End>
So, who's the lucky lady? I know all!
There's a certain nurse you have your
eye on, right?<End>
I'm not goofing off. I'm observing the
hospital. I am the head doctor, you know.
I'm doing an important job here.<End>
Let me tell you one thing. Me chatting
with the nurses? It's just friendly
workplace interaction. So... *mumble*<End>
Between you and me, I'm overworked.
I just don't show it.
<End>
Be honest.
You look up to me, don't you?<End>
Oh I see! You came to hit on the nurses!
I see everything that goes on around
here.<End>
What do you think, seeing me at work?
Does it impress you?<End>
Ah, I'm so tired. Better take a break
soon. This hospital would be in trouble
if I got sick.<End>
The hospital's doing well.
All thanks to me.
Good doctors make the difference.<End>
By the way, don't you have a girlfriend?
Don't blush, you can tell me.<End>
Listen here...
If you introduce me to a cutie, I can give
you a discount on your medical bills.<End>
Just between you and me, there's this
old battleaxe of a nurse here...
Even I'm afraid of her.<New>
What do you think of me?
See how busy I am?<End>
Are you studying properly?
Can't go cruising through school.<End>
When I was your age, all I did was play
around.
Those were the days...<End>
Got any young female friends?
I'll make it worth your while...
Set me up, will ya?<End>
Nurse Battleaxe is off today.
I can goof around.
...I mean... forget I said that...<End>
I'm not goofing off! This is just good
human relations, here! A good head
doctor stops to chat with the staff...<End>
Just once... I'd like to have a woman
I can tell my woes to...<End>
Listen, Matthew... being in a position of
influence... It may LOOK cushy... but it's
actually tough work. REAL tough.<End>
It's criminal a man like me isn't
swimming in women.
Hey, any of the nurses catch your eye?<End>
Ah, so tired.
You know, I made this hospital what it is.<End>
Horrible things happening. Just horrible.
I've got a delicate mind, you know.<End>
I was just thinking about you.
About which of the nurses would do
for you.<End>
I've got that old-school cool.
But as the years pass, I grow uneasy.<End>
Lately, I've been dreaming about my
younger days. Guess I'm getting old.
It's a terrible thing, Matthew.<End>
Hi, Matthew.
Got trouble with the ladies? I can advise.
Come to me any time.<End>
You're not done here yet?
I'm off home shortly.<End>
All work and no play...
Bring me some juicy tales. Of what you
get up to with girls... you know.<End>
This hospital's grown so big...
All thanks to my leadership.<End>
Huh? No, I'm not goofing off!
I'm checking patient lists!<End>
I know all.
You're desperate to chat up a nurse,
right? Just be honest!<End>
Ho ho! I see! Girl catch your eye?
Oh, don't be bashful...
Tell me everything!<End>
By the way...
Matthew, haven't you got a girl?<End>
You wanna sit on this chair?
Makes you feel like the big man!<End>
Time for examinations.
See you later.<End>
Do you get colds often?
No? Good! You're in robust health.<End>
Hmm... ahem...
Say, Matthew... Isn't it about time you
set me up with a cutie?<End>
No, I'm not goofing off...
You've got the wrong end of the stick.<End>
Matthew!
I mean it, hook me up with a cutie!
We've got a deal, okay?<End>
I've got a minute to give you a checkup.
.
.
.
Perfect health!<End>
Say, Matthew...
Stop stalling and set me up with a cutie!
Okay?<End>
I'm heading home.
Are you here visiting someone?<End>
Ugh, YOU first thing in the morning?<End>
Bring a cute girl sometime.<End>
Okay, I can see where you'd be confused,
but...
No, I'm NOT goofing off.<End>
Guess I'll go on my rounds...<End>
Don't loiter here or Nurse Battleaxe
will blow her top.<End>
Time to finish up loose ends before the
year ends.<End>
What a lonely Christmas it was for me.
Well, there's always next year...<End>
I'm just being friendly with the nurses!
Yes, friendly!<End>
Well, it's the end of the year...
Any of the nurses catch your eye?
You can tell me...<End>
Barbara smokes like a chimney.
I should remind her it's bad for her
health.<End>
Barbara's condition isn't good.
She's got a sickly pallor to her.<End>
Barbara smokes like a chimney.
I've tried warning her, but she won't
listen.<End>
Yeah, you know... so, a weird, horrible
incident's happened... but apart from
that, it's been a great year!<End>
I'm done for the day.
I want to head home and put my feet up.<End>
Hmm, the year's almost up...
And I didn't get to go on a date with a
single nurse...<End>
Matthew...
You can usually find me in this room,
or in the lobby.<End>
What's that?
You really like this hospital, eh?<End>
Phew... things have finally calmed down
for a spell.
Come see me if you find anything out.<End>
Did you want something?
I've got clinic duty now.<End>
I have to talk to Barbara, so later.<End>
I've still got work to do.
I don't have time to chat.<End>
Are you feeling unwell at all?<End>
I'm taking a break.<End>
Phew... I'm tired.
Come and see me again if you find any
clues.<End>
I want to do all I can to help locate
Emma.
Come anytime. I mean it.<End>
Matthew... Barbara seems to have a bit
of time on her hands.
Why don't you go and keep her company?<End>
I'm off home now.
The hospital's about to close up, anyway.<End>
Now, how to spend the evening?
The usual bar, I guess...<End>
Hey!
Quit staring.<End>
Listen...
If you're not sick, stop loitering here.<End>
If you've got something to tell me,
then fine.
but otherwise, don't disturb my work.<End>
I should take a vacation soon.<End>
If you find ANYTHING out about Emma,
you come and see me.<End>
Don't go bothering the patients.<End>
If you've got any questions,
come see me.<End>
Good luck, Detective!<End>
I should take a vacation to keep my mind
clear.<End>
Matthew...
Why not go and say hello to Barbara?<End>
I'll be in Exam Room 2.<End>
Anything about Emma's case bothering
you?
Come talk to me about anything.<End>
My examination's over now.
<End>
Guess I'll hit the bar. A cold one after
work always hits the spot.
Not that you'd know anything about that.<End>
What's up?
You're out and about quite early.<End>
I have to work now.
Don't you have anything you should be
doing?<End>
What?
Are you interested in this line of work?<End>
Just taking a break.<End>
Find any clues about Emma?<End>
If you find out anything, come see me.<End>
You like to watch me at work?<End>
Don't stare at me.
I can't work if you're going to do that.<End>
You should attend one of my lectures on
Native American history.<End>
I'm working hard, you know.<End>
Are you visiting someone?<End>
I go to the bar every evening.<End>
I'll be stopping by the bar for a drink
again tonight.<End>
Almost time to head to the bar.
Why don't you join me?<End>
You're out and about quite early.<End>
I have to work now.<End>
I thought you were a patient!<End>
Just taking a breather.
<End>
Huh?
Oh, I was just contemplating something.
<End>
Don't loiter around here.
The nurses will tell you off.<End>
I'll be at the bar tonight, so stop by.<End>
Dangerous things have been happening
in town.
You'd better watch yourself.<End>
How are you feeling?
I can examine you if there's anything
wrong.<End>
I was just contemplating something.<End>
You thought I was slacking off?
Great minds need to take frequent
breaks.<End>
I'll be at the bar tonight.
You should come.<End>
I'm done with work for today.
I could use a drink.<End>
I'm off to the bar. You coming?<End>
You're out and about quite early.<End>
I want to do some research with my
time off.<End>
How's the Emma investigation?<End>
How about taking a break?<End>
The head doctor's always bothering
the nurses.
Have you seen him at it?<End>
Time to work.
Detective, you'd better get to it, as well.<End>
Stop by and see Barbara sometimes.<End>
Good luck with the Emma case.
I'm supporting you all the way.<End>
Don't hit on the nurses.
Don't be THAT guy... you know who
I mean.<End>
Oh, yeah...
If you're interested, let's discuss Native
American history.<End>
Okay, back to work.<End>
I'll be at the bar tonight.
You should come.<End>
Time to stretch my legs.<End>
I'm off for a drink.<End>
Good morning.
Anything new on the Emma case?<End>
I have examination hours now.
Come whenever you find anything new.<End>
Anything new on the Emma case?<End>
Just gonna take a break in the lobby.<End>
Anything about the Emma case
stand out to you?<End>
Emma's been gone a long time now.<End>
I'll help any way I can.
Ask me anything.<End>
How's the investigation?
If I can help in any way, let me know.<End>
Ugh, so tired.<End>
Once you start earning a living, you'll
know the importance of breaks.<End>
Aren't you scared of Nurse Battleaxe?<End>
I still have work to do.
Can it wait until later?<End>
And so, my work ends for the year.<End>
Tomorrow's the weekend, finally.
Time to focus on my research.<End>
Matthew...
you're a good kid.<End>
Matthew...
Don't forget to bring cigarettes when
you visit.<End>
You like TV, don't you?
I get that feeling about you.<End>
I have nothing to enjoy but cigarettes.
Do you find me boring?<End>
Do you have a girlfriend?
Instead of wasting time here, why not
take her on a date?<End>
Come by my room any time. It's on the
second floor, last door on the right.<End>
The head doctor here spends all his time
flirting.
Are you the same?<End>
Come to visit me?
Then I hope you brought what I asked for.<End>
This hospital is very nice.
Except for that gross head doctor.<End>
On the TV show I often watch,
there's an actor who looks just like you.
It ISN'T you, is it?<End>
How vexing!
No lighter, no cigarettes...<End>
Guess I'll just take a nap.
...I can't sleep if YOU'RE here.<End>
Hmm...
Where can I get some cigarettes...<End>
Oh, by the way...
I'd like to get a look at your girlfriend.
Bring her with you next time.<End>
Is it all right for you to be loitering
here?
Get a move on!<End>
If you've got time to come here, you must
not have much to do.<End>
That silly moustachioed doctor...
Besmirching his father's good name...<End>
I love this infomercial!
You can dust right into the nooks and
crannies with that!<New>
...I'd love one of those.<End>
Sigh...
THAT would be a nice present...<End>
I wonder how many "happy birthday"s
I'll get this year?<End>
I couldn't smoke my cigarettes.
Don't lose the lighter this time.<End>
What TV shows do you watch?
I love the shopping channel.
You can buy stuff over the phone!<End>
Don't hit on the nurses.<End>
Cigarettes...
Nothing else cuts through the
irritations of life.<End>
That doctor has a head full of nonsense.
What a silly man.<End>
You look very handsome today!
Only joking, hee hee.<End>
I can't wait to get my birthday present
from Liz!
She's such a good girl.<End>
James wished me happy birthday!
It felt a bit awkward to be honest.<End>
Another year older, without incident...
Unless you count what's been happening
lately...<End>
This show's fascinating.
I can't wait for my birthday.<End>
Horrible things have been happening.
And it was such a good year, too...<End>
You look very dashing today.
Hehe.
See you later, Matthew.<End>
I do hate waking up.
All the bad memories come flooding back.<End>
Cigarettes taste good.
They make me feel glad to be alive.<End>
Ugh, so boring!
That doctor always seems to be enjoying
himself...<End>
I couldn't sleep last night.
I just lay awake reliving terrible
memories...<End>
Is it all right for you to be loitering
here?
Get a move on!<End>
I bet you chase after the nurses,
just like that slimy doctor.<End>
Back to my room, I guess.<End>
Are you sure you should be here?
Don't you have anywhere else to be?<End>
You don't have to keep me company.
I can tell you don't like me.<End>
The head doctor here is so lazy.
Always goofing off.<End>
That head doctor, ugh.
And his father was such a brilliant
doctor, too...<End>
To me, cigarettes are like...
like a magic charm to keep the bad
thoughts away.<End>
I saw that doctor bothering the nurses
again.
Disgusting.<End>
Aren't you the busy one lately?
Not like that lazy doctor.<End>
Haven't you got things to do?

Why are you goofing around here?<End>
I had a strange dream...
About what happened, all those years
ago...<End>
Hmm.
That doctor's up to his usual tricks
again.<End>
I saw that doctor bothering the nurses
again.
Revolting.<End>
By the way, Matthew...
Can't you try to do something about that
doctor?<End>
Oh my...
Felt a little dizzy then.
Maybe I'll take a nap.<End>
I keep thinking about Emma...
Hmm...<End>
It's the end of the year...
I hope you'll come by next year too.
With cigarettes, of course.<End>
Hmm? Nowhere else to be?
...I mean, I do enjoy your visits.<End>
What's up?
Don't you feel sorry for me, being
hospitalised at Christmas?<End>
Horrible things are happening...
It's just like how it was back then...<End>
I feel so uneasy...
I just can't seem to calm down...<End>
My heart is so heavy.
Emma...
That poor girl...<End>
I've got a bad feeling... just like it was
back then... I feel like something else
terrible is about to happen...<End>
I thought I should look at this case from
a different angle.
So, I came here.<End>
How nice of you to visit a sick patient.
I can't fault your morals.<End>
To be honest, I'm lost.
What's happening to this town?<End>
No, I didn't come for a physical.
Don't worry about me.<End>
Absurd!
I came to talk to the head doctor but they
told me he's too busy to be disturbed!<End>
My younger sister worked here, but she
got fired. I tried to fix it for her, but
it was no good.<End>
This is ridiculous...
How long am I going to be kept waiting?!<End>
It's almost 10, so please come back
tomorrow.<End>
...<End>
Oh well, I guess I'll head home.<End>
Reception is closed from 8pm.<End>
Oh, right.<End>
We're not open past 8.
Please head back downstairs.<End>
Oh, hello.
Can I help you?<End>
It's supposed to be Christmas...<End>
It won't open.<End>
I can hear excited voices inside.<End>
