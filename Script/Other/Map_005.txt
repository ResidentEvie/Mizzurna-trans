Hey hey, what do you want?<End>
?! Emma!!!<End>
 Matthew... Matthew, it's you...<End>
Emma, are you all right?<End>
Don't get too chatty, kid.
She's all tired out.<End>
...?!<End>
Don't ruin their touching reunion scene.<End>
Wolf! You're the one who did this!<End>
Yep. I was behind everything.
Now, aren't you satisfied?<End>
You're the one who was behind Dennis's
murder, too!<End>
...You squealed?<End>
...Whoops.<End>
Your tongue couldn't be any looser.<End>
Why have you done this to Emma?!<End>
She was going to ruin us, threatened to
squeal on us for dealing Epoch. Jeez, we
shoulda just killed her in the first place. <End>
Would have been a waste.
A waste just to kill her.<End>
When I came across her stumbling along
the road that night, I was so happy,
 I could have cried. <End>
That night? The night of the 24th?<End>
Hey kid, what does it matter now,
anyway? Both you and her are going to
be dead in a minute.<End>
As soon as I put a match to this gasoline,
you two will be burned to a crisp along
with this warehouse.<End>
Stop!<End>
...Well, well!<End>
Hey, this kid's pointing a gun at me.<End>
Give Emma to me!<End>
You want her?<End>
Matthew...<End>
Emma!<End>
Throw the gun away!<End>
Damn it...<End>
Wolf, let me handle the kid.<End>
...Do as you wish.<End>
I have to pay you back for that stunt you
pulled in the hospital.<End>
...<End>
Don't worry, kid, I'll take you on
hand-to-hand.<End>
Now come at me!<End>
Guhhh...<End>
Hey! What the hell are you doing,
losing to a kid?!<End>
Gahh...<End>
You useless idiot!
You couldn't kill Isabella, and now this!<End>
Y-You shut your face...<End>
What did you say?!<End>
Shut up... just shut up!<End>
Say it one more time. I dare you.<End>
I said shut up!<End>
If you had just killed the girl in the
beginning, none of this would have
happened!<End>
...<End>
This whole thing has been mishandled
every step of the way!<End>
I knew things were off when that jerk
betrayed us...<End>
I was the only one who didn't know...<End>
?!<End>
Shut up.<End>
...<End>
Jesus... this is taking up too much time...<End>
Killing her should be easy...<End>
?! Bastard!<End>
Heh... serves you... right...<End>
You're dead! Eat shit!<End>
DIE!!!<End>
Waah!<End>
?!<End>
Morgan?<End>
Shit... bastard!
All this cause you couldn't do your job!<End>
Emma!<End>
This way!<End>
*Gasp*

Persistent kid...<End>
What's wrong?<End>
*Gasp*<End>
Shit...<End>
Out of bullets...?<End>
Emma!<End>
...Back!<End>
?!<End>
Stay back! The Epoch... it's wearing off...<End>
Quickly...<End>
Guhhh!<End>
?!<End>
What's wrong? Didn't you come here to
save Emma?<End>
?!<End>
If it weren't for this, I'd have stayed
weak, pathetic!<End>
You should get a taste of it too.
Then you'd see how wonderful it is.<End>
I'm not interested in something that'll
make me lose myself!<End>
Yourself? Don't make me laugh! What's
a self? Something like that doesn't
even exist in this world!<End>
What are you saying?! I know that I am
who I am!<End>
You don't get to decide who you are.
God decides that.<End>
God? God again?! Who gives a damn?!<End>
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not talking
about the Christian God, or Buddha.<End>
I'm talking about the force of nature
that controls us all from the shadows!<End>
I'm not controlled by anybody!
I act of my own free will!<End>
Pitiful...<End>
He throws a stone, and thinks he can
take the credit for making it fly.<End>
Like a drop of rain falling in the ocean,
I can become one with God by taking this!<End>
Come, then! Just try taking Emma from
me!<End>
Gahh...<End>
Emma...<End>
Matthew?<End>

?!<End>
Give her to me! Ugh!<End>
?! 
<End>
You... bastard...<End>
Are you all right?<End>
Ughh... My... my body...<End>
Emma!<End>
Too late for her... she's already
addicted to the wonders of God...<End>
You drugged her!<End>
Matthew... it hurts...<End>
Emma! Hold on!<End>
Ughh...<End>
Emma... come on!<End>
Emma?!<End>
