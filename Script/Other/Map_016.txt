It's a computer for viewing library
materials.<End>
You can also view the large collection of
microfilm.<End>
I don't need to look anything up right
now...<End>
There's a number written on the phone.
 □○○× ...This must be the staff
room's direct number.<End>
It's a poster for the Full Moon Party
they had at the start of this month.
Why hasn't anyone taken it down yet?<End>
Party committee volunteers, call us on
○○×□
(Party Committee Chief)<End>
Is this the book Winona was talking
about?<End>
It's titled
'History of Philosophy'.<End>
...<End>
...Hmm? There's a bookmark stuck
between the pages.<End>
"Nothing exists, and if it did, no one can
be aware of it, and if anyone was aware
of it, they could not communicate it<New>
to others."<End>
Kinda dark... Did Emma leave this
bookmark here?
I could ask James about it...<End>
Maybe I'll take another look...<End>
...<End>
Hmm...<End>
Where are the books on philosophy?<End>
The second bookshelf from the right
along the corridor wall. They're
on the top shelf, but I bet you can reach.<End>
Did you find the book you wanted?<End>
Matthew...
I wouldn't expect to see YOU in the
library.<End>
Miss Holden...<End>
I heard, about Kathy.<End>
...<End>
Do you think Kathy and Emma were
together?<End>
Who knows... I have no idea...<End>
I wonder if there's really any connection
with Kathy's case?<End>
What do you mean?<End>
I'm not really sure, but I think that Emma
was troubled about something, and that's
likely to be why she disappeared...<End>
Troubled about what?<End>
Well...
<End>
I don't really understand it myself...
It's so... abstract...<End>
...<End>
I'm sorry... 
I can't really explain.<End>
I'm going back to the staff room.<End>
Hmm? What are you both doing here?<End>
We want to get into the main building.<End>
Matthew, it's off-limits.<End>
Um, I left my notebook in my desk
drawer. I really need it...<End>
...<End>
...I can't get it?<End>
Well, Winona, since it's you... I can trust
you.<End>
...<End>
You can take the key on the rack over
there. But please return it once
you're done.<End>
Thank you.<End>
Lots of keys here.<End>
Hmm, which key...<End>
There's the key to the main building and
the classroom. We'll have to return
them quickly or we'll get in trouble.<End>
It won't open...<End>
It's locked.<End>
Doesn't look like Liz is here.
Let's just put the keys back.<End>
Okay.
Let's head home for today.<End>
Yeah.<End>
We have to return the keys.
Liz is waiting.<End>
Did you find your notebook?<End>
It wasn't there. I must have left it
somewhere else...<End>
...

Oh, well.<End>
Sorry... here's the keys back.<End>
It's all right. But you can't go back into
the main building again, okay?
Off you go now.<End>
Okay. Matthew, let's go!<End>
I understand you two are both worried
about Emma, but don't get too involved.
Just leave the investigation to the police.<End>
...<End>
What should we do about the camera
and the disk?<End>
I'll take the camera to the photo shop in
the central square. As for the disk,
well, I'll investigate.<New>
If I find anything, I'll call you.<End>
Okay. I'm curious about something so I'm
going to see Father Barton.<End>
All right.<End>
Bye, then. Make sure to call me.<End>
Miss... Holly? Are you Kathy's homeroom
teacher?<End>
Yes, and who are you?<End>
I'm Matthew Williams. Uh, I'd like to ask
you some questions about Kathy, if that's
all right.<End>
Oh my, surely Kathy never had a
boyfriend like you. Am I right?<End>
Oh my...
 Well...<End>
Uh, yeah. What kind of girl was Kathy?<End>
I'm not sure she had anyone you could
call a friend...<End>
I never once saw her talking happily
with anyone.<End>
So you mean she avoided others?<End>
But it's not like she was just shy.
She seemed to deliberately distance
herself. She seemed intentionally cold.<End>
I tried to talk to her, told her she ought
to try to make friends, that being with
others is fun. And you know what she<New>
said?
"I have the lord, and my father."<End>
That's kind of creepy.<End>
But her words didn't strike me as
genuine. I think she was deceiving
herself on some level. <End>
So Kathy was always alone at school?<End>
Well, one day she joined the Full Moon
Party planning committee out of the blue.<End>
The party that was held back at the
start of December?<End>
I was shocked, too. But of course, I was
all for it.<End>
So did that go well for Kathy?<End>
Who knows? She ended up quitting soon
after. And after that, she was no
different. Not that she would have been.<End>
I wonder what possessed her
to do that...
Such a mysterious girl.<End>
I see.<End>
If you find anything out, please let me
know.<End>
I can look at newspapers from 40 years
ago with this.<End>
I'll just input the date, and...<End>
Here it is!<End>
...On December 31st, 40 years ago...<End>
A youth living at the church, who went by
the name Cougar... murdered someone.<End>
Cougar, who was 24 at the time,
attempted to perform the "Death
Journey Ritual"<New>
once carried out by the indigenous
peoples of the area, using Barbara's 18
year old sister as a sacrifice...<End>
Cougar killed the girl, then attempted to
revive her as part of the ritual. However
the girl was unable to be resuscitated...<End>
"By dying once and coming back, one can
gain eternal life"...<End>
Cougar used the girl as a guinea pig in
his lust to obtain eternal life for
himself...<End>
In the end, Cougar was hunted down into
the forest where he took his own life,
hoping that he would be resurrected<New>
as part of the ritual...<End>
Eternal life...<End>
I should ask James about the ritual...<End>
Is the main building closed?<End>
Yes, the principal's had it locked up
after what's happened.<End>
But I want to go in.<End>
No can do. Besides, you're not the type
of student who'd come to school during
a vacation.<End>
I guess you're right...<End>
Matthew, did you come to read?
If you're looking for a particular book,
you can ask the librarian, or check the<New>
shelves by genre.
This library has a LOT of books.<End>
Huh, me? I thought I'd look up the history
of what happened in Barrows Forest
way back.<New>
There's something I'm curious about.<End>
By the way, I'm impressed.
Do you often come here to study during
vacations?<End>
I don't feel too good lately.
<End>
Ah, the life of a student.
Fill that head with knowledge!<End>
What a horrible thing to happen...
Poor Winona must be suffering.
Try to cheer her up, won't you?<End>
Kathy's funeral is from 9:30.
Are you going to pay your last respects,
too?<End>
Did you come to ask about Emma?
It's true, I was close with her. But so
was my grandmother.<New>
They often had these long chats...
But my Grandma's in hospital right now
for her bad feet.<End>
The library closes at 6.
I'm going to finish up my work and head
to the hospital around 5.<End>
You came to study at the library?
Oh my, now that's unexpected.
What next, red snow?<End>
I understand how you're worried for
Emma.
Let's pray she's found soon.<End>
Listen, Matthew...
If you find out anything about Emma,
go to Morgan.<New>
We should help any way we can with
the investigation.<End>
Oh, there's a book you ought to read...
I'll lend it to you sometime.<End>
You're up bright and early!
I wish you were this enthusiastic
during class...<End>
Matthew...
You can talk to me any time, you know?<End>
Matthew, you probably get this already,
but... if you find out anything, go to
Morgan.<New>
Don't get yourself involved in anything
dangerous.<End>
I understand, you don't want to just sit
around doing nothing... but there's not
much else we can do until Emma's found.<End>
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Let's talk another time.<End>
By the way, Matthew...
Are you doing your reading?
Feel free to relax in the library.<End>
Matthew...
Do you want to study together in the
library?<End>
You seem very engrossed in the library!
Shame you don't show the same interest
in class.<End>
Horrible things have been happening
lately.
What's happening to this town?<End>
I hate that my students have been
caught up in danger...<End>
Come talk to me anytime.
Don't be shy.<End>
Don't walk around late at night.
I know, you're not going to listen to me.<End>
Matthew, read your books quietly.
We become the books we read.<End>
It's cold out.
Don't get a chill.<End>
Sorry, i'm a bit busy.
Can you come back later?<End>
Feel free to read at your leisure in the
library.
We've got some good books in recently.<End>
The year's about to end...
Stay warm.<End>
What are you doing in a place like this?
Is the world ending tomorrow?
Haha, just kidding.<End>
My research has stalled recently.
I need a breakthrough.<End>
Matthew.
If you like books, I can lend you a good
one.<End>
I've come to a dead end in my research.
Can't make any progress.
There must be a way, somehow...<End>
About my research...
A... problem has come up.
But I think I can finally solve it.<End>
Emma often read books.
She read this big, complex-looking
philosophy book a lot.<End>
Did you see Liz?
She seems worried about us.<End>
I'm looking for a book.
Emma was reading it... I thought it might
help me understand her...<End>
Look at us, studying in the library
during winter break. Total nerds!<End>
Hmm... I can't find the book I'm looking
for. Guess I'll check the noticeboard
then head home.<End>
If I read the same book as Emma, maybe
I'll understand her...<End>
The book Emma was reading is really
hard to understand. Although I feel a bit
closer to her, having read it.<New>
I'm... totally useless.<End>
I've never borrowed a book.<End>
It's almost 6. Students have to leave
now.<End>
...<End>
Oh well, I'll come another time.<End>
What should I do?
Give up and go home?<End>
Yeah.
No way!<End>
Yeah.
Let's check Emma's locker!<End>
Yeah.
Let's come another time.<End>
I'm heading home.
See you, Matthew.<End>
