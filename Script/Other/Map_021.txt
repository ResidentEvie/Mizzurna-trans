Mel Astin, 18<End>
Dennis's only child, known in town as a
bad boy.<End>
Highly irritable, he's a rebel without
a cause.<End>
Lorraine Haines, 20<End>
Waitress at the diner.
She's straight-talking, and has a
pleasant yet frank personality.<End>
She's dating Mel, but they're often
in a fight.
Maybe they're suited to each other.<End>
Yeah, no one was hurt.
Okay, so some money was stolen, but it
could have been a lot worse.<End>
That's true...
I'm sure the robbers will be found soon.<End>
Huh?<End>
It's a small town, after all.<End>
Oh, right...<End>
You seem busy.<End>
Not as much as usual.<End>
I heard Emma's gone missing?<End>
Lorraine, do you know Kathy?<End>
The girl who's a friend of God? 
I don't,
really. 
She's always by herself, anyway.<End>
I think there's bound to be a connection
between Kathy and Emma's
disappearance.<End>
Were they friends?<End>
Who knows...

As far as I know, they weren't.<End>
But they were actually kind of similar,
weren't they?<End>
In what way?<End>
Not in any specific way. Just that you
could never tell what either of them
was thinking.<End>
...Yeah.<End>
What's wrong with you?

You look grumpy.<End>
Nothing's wrong, don't nag.
Lorraine, finish up here 
and let's
go drink.<End>
I can't. 
My dad's not here today.

I have to take care of the place
by myself.<End>
It's your place, so just close up early,
what's the big deal?<End>
I can't do that. 
If you want to talk,
let's talk here.<End>
Jeez!

Everyone's pissing me off today.<End>
What happened?<End>
This morning I got interrogated by that
fatass,
 thinks I've got something to do
with the Emma thing.<End>
Morgan?<End>
Yeah, that fat pig.
 So what if I was the
 last person to see Emma?!<End>
Where did you see Emma?<End>
Huh?<End>
I said, where did you see Emma?<End>
Hey, jerk! 
What makes you think I have
to tell you?<End>
I saw Emma last  night, too. 
I want to 
know where she went afterwards.<End>
Jeez, you're annoying. <End>
I want to know, too.
 Just exactly whenz
and where did you meet Emma last
night?!<End>
What are you thinking?!

I didn't MEET her.

I just saw her in passing!<End>
So, where?<End>
Jeez...<End>
It was on Cockland Peaks.

Just where you come out of the tunnel.<End>
Did you two talk?<End>
Not really.

But she said she was goin' to the church. <End>
The church? 
Was she alone?<End>
Hey jerk! 
That's enough.<End>
I don't have to sit here and be
interrogated by you two as well.<End>
Are you leaving?<End>
I can't stay here. It's suffocating me!<End>
Urgh, what a dick...<End>
Aren't you two going out?<End>
Yeah, well.

Everyone's got their good points.<End>
Hey! 
That's impossible, are you crazy?!<Unk70><End>
It's the only option.<End>
What are you thinking?!
I never expected you to ask something
like this of me!<End>
Tch...<End>
I'll come back later.

Just think about what I said.<End>
Something happened?<End>
...No... it's nothing.<End>
It seems like he was being a jerk
as usual.<End>
...<End>
Matthew!
<End>
Matthew! Over here!
<End>
Hey!
Did you come here for a hamburger
too, Matthew?<End>
Lorraine!
Matthew will have the same.<End>
.<End>
..<End>
...Huh?<End>
Weren't you listening?
<End>
Uh, a coffee refill?

Sure thing...<End>
What's with her?<End>
...<End>
Did you find out anything about the
burglary?<End>
Oh, that.
<End>
It seems Emma's diary was stolen.<End>
Yeah.<End>
We're investigating.<End>
Why not take a seat?<End>
Nobody move!!!<End>
?!<End>
What the!<End>
?!<End>
Hey! The pig's here!<End>
Shit! Never mind that.
<End>
Nobody move a muscle!<End>
What do you think you're doing?!<End>
Don't move!
 Freeze!<End>
Try anything crazy,
 and someone's
gonna get hurt!<End>
Gah!<End>
Put the money in the bag!<End>
But...<End>
Just do it!<End>
Hey!
Stop this foolishness this instant!<End>
Shut up! 
Just shut your mouth!<End>
Unless you want to die!<End>
Morgan!<End>
Stay back, Matthew.
 Don't give these
jerks an excuse.<End>
Let's get out of here!<End>
This guy's gonna pay up, too!<End>
Forget them! 
Let's just go!<End>
Just listen to me...

Do what he says, Matthew.<End>
Do you hear me?!<End>
You, hand over all your money.<End>
No way!<End>
Matthew!<End>
Do what he says!<End>
What makes you think you can hide from
the police in a small town like this?<End>
Hey!
 Are you mental? 
Haven't you
figured out the situation you're in?<End>
Please! 
Just do what he says!<End>
...<End>
Matthew, that's a real gun!

Just hand over your money!<End>
Do what he says, Matthew!
<End>
...<End>
Should have done that in the first
place, genius!<End>
What? 
That's all you got?!<End>
Forget it! 
No way that kid would have
a lot of cash on him.<End>
Quit jerking around!

Let's get out of here!<End>
Shit...<End>
Do you know how much was taken?<End>
I don't know...
<End>
But all the takings from yesterday
were in there. I'm sure it's quite a lot.<End>
Hmm. That's very unfortunate.<End>
Well?<End>
We haven't found the getaway car.

All we can be sure of is that it hasn't
left town.<End>
I see...<End>
I'm going back to the sheriff's
department.<End>
Perhaps Emma was going to the church
to see Kathy?<End>
I think you could be right.<End>
I bet that's it. 
It's likely the two of them
were together, then.<End>
I wonder if there's another protest
going on at Astin Farm again today.<End>
Protest?
What protest?<End>
Don't you know? 
The farm workers are
protesting because Dennis won't
refurbish their lodgings.<End>
Dennis? 
As in Mel's father?<End>
Yeah. You know, the farm workers'
lodgings are on the top of Cockland
Peaks.<End>
Oh, yeah. 
They're pretty run-down. <End>
Dennis should just do the decent thing
and refurbish them.<End>
Astin Farm's rolling in money after all.<End>
Some of the farm workers were just
here.<End>
Were they talking about refurbishing?<End>
They were just bitching about Dennis.<End>
It's true the place is worn-down, though.
And it's got a creepy vibe.
Dennis should just rebuild.<End>
Mel said there's some reason why
they can't.<End>
What kind of reason?<End>
I don't really know, but it doesn't seem
to be about money.<End>
Mel's such a jerk...<End>
What's wrong?<End>
Mel's been such a grouch today.

All he does is bitch and moan.<End>
Seems he didn't exactly love being
questioned by Morgan.<End>
Who knows.<End>
Matthew, have you seen Mel?<End>
Nope.
<End>
He's been weird since this morning...

Kind of on edge...<End>
He's always on edge.<End>
That's true...<End>
Jeez...<End>
What's up?<End>
I can't get in contact with Mel.

He must be out walking somewhere.<End>
What's wrong?<End>
It's just... Mel came in here looking
really pale...<End>
All fidgety...<End>
Something bad must be going on...<End>
I heard there was a break-in at Emma's?<Unk70><End>
Yeah.<End>
Was anything taken?<End>
I don't know for sure. But Sarah said
Emma's diary is missing.<End>
Emma's diary?
Why would something
like that go missing?<End>
No idea.
 But maybe it's linked to this
case.<End>
...<End>
Lorraine?<End>
?! Matthew?!
Don't startle me!

What are you doing here?!<End>
...<End>
Lorraine, you look pale.<End>
Do I? I'm fine...<End>
Morgan must be busy right around now...<End>
Why are you mentioning that?<End>
No reason...<End>
I just figured, he's probably so busy with
the investigation that he hasn't had time
for lunch.<End>
Well, I guess that's possible.<End>
Honestly...<End>
I never thought Mel would be THAT
stupid...<End>
Oh, you finally realized he's an idiot, huh?<End>
Matthew?!
Don't scare me!!!<End>
Lorraine, you seem weird today.<End>
...<End>
Pretty bad thing that happened.<End>
...<End>
You got any ideas?<End>
Ideas...?
What do you mean, ideas?<End>
I'm not on friendly terms with any
masked robbers!<End>
Why were yesterday's takings still in
the cash register?<End>
I was... tired last night.
I just left them in there for... next time.<End>
Do you know anything about guns,
Lorraine?<End>
I've never even touched one.<End>
Then how did you know that robber's
gun just now was a real one?<End>
...<End>
You did say that, didn't you?
 When that
guy had his gun drawn on me, you said:
"that's a real gun".<End>
That was... I...<End>
You know something, don't you?<End>
...<End>
It was HIM, wasn't it?<End>
But I was against the whole idea!

I SAID it wouldn't go smoothly!
Yes... he did it...<End>
It was... him...<End>
...<End>
He's such an idiot...<End>
He must be laying low somewhere
right now. 
I don't know where, though.<End>
Hmm, now which way did the car go?<End>
Have you seen Mel?<End>
I have no idea where he could be.<End>
I think of all people you would know.<End>
Look, I'm looking for him myself!

But...<End>
...<End>
Oh, jeez... he's such an idiot...

and he's dragging me down with him...<End>
How long has Mel been doing drugs?<End>
I want you to believe this. 
I've never
heard anything about Mel having this
Epoch.<New>
If he HAS been doing drugs,
 he must
have started really recently.<End>
What about the robbery?<End>
He never said anything to me about
buying drugs. He just said he needed
a large amount of cash...<End>
Anyway, I bet anything that Mel will
contact you at some point.<End>
I hope so...<End>
...<End>
I feel like Lorraine might try to do
something today...<End>
Dennis is being such a jerk.<End>
I'm gonna bombard him with phone
calls in protest.
Every morning I'm gonna call him.<End>
What's his number again?<End>
Er...<End>
let's see...
□○△△ ...<End>
Okay... now we attack him with phone
calls!<End>
Phone bombardment plan in progress!
The number is □○△△!<End>
Welcome!
What can I get you?<End>
How about another?<End>
You want a cheeseburger, huh?
Coming right up.<End>
Omelette's four dollars.
You like your eggs a little runny, right?<End>
You want pancakes, huh?
I hope you like our special, super-sweet
syrup.<End>
You want fried chicken, huh?
It'll take me a minute to fire up
the deep fryer.<End>
Okay.
You want coffee, huh?
I know how you like it... nice and strong!<End>
You want milk, huh?
I know you love your milk, Matthew.<End>
Today's special is steak!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is the beef sandwich!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is fried rice!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is the fish burger!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is the baked potato!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is lasagna!
I hope you're hungry!<End>
Today's special is the ham and
egg sandwich.
I hope you're hungry!<End>
It'll be ready before you know it.<End>
You sure do love to eat, don't you?
Where do you put it all?<End>
Here you go!<End>
Huh?
You're short of cash?
Well, isn't that  a shame.<End>
Changed your mind?
Don't let it get cold.
<End>
I just don't feel like eating.
I wonder if Emma has enough
to eat right now...<End>
Order your own damn food.
Go eat shit for all I care.<End>
Eat whatever the hell you want.
Don't ask for my advice, I don't give
a damn!<End>
What's your problem?
Can't even eat on your own?<End>
I have something to discuss with
Lorraine.
I don't have time to listen to you!<End>
I came here to eat!
I didn't come here to listen to your crap!<End>
Don't talk to me.
Your face is putting me off my food.<End>
What do you want?
Your face is putting me off my food.<End>
Do you mind if I eat my meal in peace?!
<End>
Huh?
Don't look at me like I'm a freak!<End>
Quit pissin' me off!
I'm eatin' here!
<End>
Lorraine seems uneasy.
Is she involved in what happened?<End>
I have to eat to keep up my strength for
the investigation.
Mental strength as well as physical!<End>
Are you eating your three meals a day?
Eat up! When I was YOUR age,
I ate five meals a day!<End>
Can't risk fainting on the job.
Gotta give it my all until we solve
this case.<End>
Sigh...
So one of those robbers was Mel...
God...
<End>
A robbery here yesterday...
How frightening.
<End>
The bigwigs in this town just LOVE
meetings.
I don't really care though...<End>
I don't really know this area.
I plan to just drive around and explore.<End>
I came from the next state over.
Not much of a tourist spot is it,
this town?<End>
Don't talk to me while I'm eating.
I have to focus on my food.
Gotta show my respect to the chef!<End>
Can't believe that president!
Ignoring our requests for
refurbishments!<End>
The president won't listen to our
demands at all.
Well this time I'm gonna MAKE him listen!<End>
If you saw the state of our living
quarters, you'd understand. If only
the president would agree to rebuild...<End>
Protesting is all we can do.
This is the only hand we have left to play.<End>
Can't believe that president!
Ignoring our requests for
refurbishments!<End>
Protesting is all we can do.
This is the only hand we have left to play.<End>
The president won't listen to our
demands at all.
Well this time I'm gonna MAKE him listen!<End>
Our lives are totally shit thanks
to the president!
I just want a decent place to live!<End>
If you saw the state of our living
quarters, you'd understand. If only
the president would agree to rebuild...<End>
So tired...
Too tired to eat...<End>
How long can this keep up?
I'm just about at my limit...<End>
So tired...
Too tired to eat...<End>
Our lives are totally shit thanks to
the president!
I just want a decent place to live!<End>
How long can this keep up?
I'm just about at my limit...<End>
Feel like a bite to eat?
What can I get you?<End>
What's wrong?
I mean, I get it. But cheer up!
Just take it easy.<End>
So gloomy!
It's not like you.
Eat something, you'll feel better.<End>
...What?
Sorry...
I don't really feel like talking.<End>
Just take it easy and hang out.
I won't chase you out.<End>
What?
Just take it easy and hang out.
There's no minimum order, after all.<End>
Just take it easy and hang out.
We're neighbours, you're always
welcome.<End>
Sigh...
It's the last day of the year...
So much snow...<End>
Just take it easy and hang out.
...
Sigh... stupid Mel.<End>
Just hang out. We're neighbours
after all.
... Sigh... All I do is sigh...<End>
It's the end of the year...
So cold...
You should drink something hot.<End>
Matthew...
I'm... worried about him.<End>
The year's ending...
Sigh...
God, I hope they find Emma...<End>
I've been so worried lately, I can't force
anything down. Not like I'm gonna faint
or anything, though.<End>
I'm so stressed, I can't eat anything.
I have to pull myself together...<End>
Sigh...
I have to get it together... I'm a burden
on Sarah while I'm like this...<End>
When I think about Emma...
I just can't eat.
I can't keep living like this...<End>
This town was always such a...
nice place to live...<End>
I always come around this time.
It's a little quieter in here.<End>
Hmm... This smooth, mild taste...
Oh yes, instant coffee is the best.
Ahahahahahaaa!<End>
I'm so hungry.<End>
Matthew, we're about to close.
Drop by again tomorrow, okay?<End>
