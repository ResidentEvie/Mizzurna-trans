Steve Rowland, 45<End>
Emma's father and the town mayor.<End>
He is deeply regretting the fact that he
didn't try harder to understand his
daughter.<End>
Sarah Rowland, 40<End>
Emma's mother. She has been in a
terrible state ever since Emma went
missing.<End>
You got

Emma's Key<End>
You got

Ring with a letter "I"<End>
I shouldn't just walk around the house.<End>
It's an electronic piano.
So Emma used to play...<End>
A photo of Emma.
It was taken at the Full Moon Party
at the start of this month.<End>
It's a vase. There aren't any flowers
in it.<End>
Hmm?<End>
There's something in the bottom
of the vase. <End>
There was a key hidden in the vase.
I wonder what it goes to?<End>
There was a locker key hidden 
in the
bottom of this vase.<End>
There's something in the bottom of the
vase.<End>
A key...?<End>
Will you take the key?
Yes
Not right now<End>
Sarah, do you know what this key is for?<End>
...<End>
I don't know.
I don't think it's one of the house keys.<End>
Mind if I borrow this key?<End>
Okay... I don't mind. Any ideas?<End>
No... but I just feel like I've seen this
type of key somewhere before.<End>
Anyway, I'll hold onto it for now.<End>
Hmm? Something's stuck...<End>
It's a ring...<End>
The initial "I" is carved into it.
Was this Emma's?<End>
This was stuck in the sink. Is it Emma's?<End>
I've never seen that before.<End>
Can I borrow this?<End>
Sure.<End>
This desk... 
<End>
Sarah, wasn't this desk closed before?<End>
...<End>
Oh, yes! It was definitely closed.<End>
Is anything missing?<End>
It's empty.<End>
Matthew... that drawer...<End>
?<End>
That drawer is usually always locked!<End>
What's kept in it?<End>
Her diary! One time I tried to open that
drawer, and Emma blew up at me.<End>
So her diary's missing?<End>
We should discuss this with Morgan.<End>
You're right... but why take her diary...?<End>
Matthew...<End>
Are you all right?<End>
Yes... thank you...<End>
You said... there's been a break-in?<End>
I didn't really see the burglar...
<End>
but I could sense someone's presence
in Emma's room...<End>
and the window was open a little.<End>
Is anything missing?<End>
I don't know...
<End>
Emma hated us going in her room.
We don't really know what it's like in
there.<End>
Can I take a look?<End>
Yes. I'll go with you.<End>
You're going to Emma's room?<End>
If you go, you'll notice for sure...

Something's different...<End>
Matthew?
Can I speak to you for a moment?<End>
Sure.<End>
I'm just going to look at Emma's room...<End>
Okay...<End>
Matthew, could you come down?
I'd like to talk.<End>
Matthew, Steve wants you downstairs.
Head down and see him.<End>
I'll... stay here a little longer.<End>
Thank you, Matthew... thanks to you,
Sarah's doing much better.<End>
Yes, she does seem to be.<End>
Still, I'm concerned about her refusing
to leave the house...<End>
Excuse me for changing the subject,
but did you know Kathy?<End>
I've seen her at church, but never
spoken to her. I don't really know her.<End>
Do you think she and Emma were
acquainted?<End>
Who knows...<End>
I never saw the two of them together.<End>
And I'm sure Emma would have
mentioned it to either me or Winona
if the two were acquainted in some way.<End>
I see...<End>
But you know, I've seen that boy Mel with
Kathy before.<End>
Mel?! Where?<End>
In front of the bar.<End>
I was surprised, to be honest. She didn't
seem like the kind of girl to play around
at night.<End>
That's true.<End>
Now I think about it, perhaps Emma and
Kathy were quite similar... <End>
...<End>
*SHRIEK*<End>
?!<End>
Sarah!<End>
Are you all right?<End>
 Yes. I think I've calmed down now.<End>
...Thank you.<End>
There's no sign of any break-in in the
room.<End>
I see...<End>
Possibly the stress over Emma has
made her neurotic. You should talk to
your wife.<End>
I will.<End>
I'm going back to the department.
Call me if anything comes up.<End>
All right. Thank you...<End>
Sarah's been like that all day.<End>
I see...<End>
Why did it come to this...
Why her...<End>
Matthew...<End>
Sarah...<End>
...<End>
Sarah, cheer up.<End>
All we can do is believe that Emma
will come home safe.<End>
Emma...<End>
*sob* *sniffle*<End>
Thank you, Matthew. We can't all just
descend into despair. <End>
Wherever Emma is right now, she might
be relying on us to help her.<End>
I've decided to assist Morgan in the
investigation.<End>
I see...<End>
Could you let me take a look in Emma's
room?<End>
NoOoOoOoOoOoooo<$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001><$0001>!
Don't go into her room!<End>
Sarah...
<End>
I want to help too, but could you give us
a little time?<End>
I don't want anyone going into Emma's
room until Sarah calms down.<End>
I see...<End>
Sarah... Kathy's funeral's over.<End>
Yes. I heard from Steve.<End>
...<End>
Poor Father Barton...<End>
He said he's praying for Emma.<End>
...<End>
Sarah... I can't find any proof anywhere
that Kathy and Emma were together.<End>
I think the reason Emma's missing may
not be connected after all.<End>
I think we should focus on finding out
what the real reason could be. <End>
I see...<End>
It's just as you say... we should do
everything we can...<End>
Right.<End>
Matthew... let's go to Emma's room.<End>
I think I should take another look
at it now I'm calmer. <End>
Do you know how it works?<End>
Yes, this should do it.<End>
What's this song...?<End>
Emma was always playing this...
the title is "Eternal".<End>
Eternal...<End>
It's a beautiful song.<End>
Yes, it is.<End>
I wonder how Emma was feeling
when she used to play this...<End>
I wonder if James might know something
about it...<End>
Emma...<End>
Can I ask you about how Emma was
last night?<End>
Last night, Emma got home around 8pm.
And we talked a little. <End>
About what?<End>
About how Christmas is such a sacred
day, so there must be some wonderful
power at work just on that day.<End>
Emma said that?<End>
Yes. Then she said that she was tired
and wanted to sleep, and after
that she went off to her room.<End>
I heard at the police station that Mel
saw Emma around 10pm.<End>
Really? Then she must have snuck out
again after that.<End>
I guess so.<End>
I can't believe she would do that...<End>
Sarah, cheer up...<End>
...

Thank you, Matthew.<End>
Sarah...<End>
I wonder when Kathy's funeral will be
held...
Do you know, Matthew?<End>
No...<End>
I see...<End>
Sarah, do you know anything about this
disk?<End>
A... disk?<End>
I found it in Emma's locker.<End>
It might be for the electric piano.<End>
Emma's piano?<End>
I think I've seen her putting a disk in it
before.<End>
Sarah...
Don't give up hope.
We'll find her.<End>
Steve said that...
they didn't find Emma...
they searched the whole forest...<End>
Sarah...<End>
Oh, Emma...
where have you gone?<End>
I can't believe Father Barton committed
suicide...<End>
Or that he raised his hand to Kathy...<End>
Yes...
It's tragic.<End>
I heard from Sheriff Morgan...
Emma was... doing drugs...<End>
Sarah...
We don't know that for sure...<End>
But she was involved with people who
do drugs...<End>
What kind of parent am I?<End>
I can't believe Emma was going to that
bar...<End>
We didn't know our own daughter
at all...<End>
Oh... ohhh...
Emma, where are you?<End>
oh... Emma...
Where...
Where is my Emma?<End>
...I'm sorry I worried you.
I'm... fine now.<End>
Matthew, thank you for caring.<End>
Oh, man...
How'd a burglar get in here...<End>
Why...
Why break into our house now,
of all times?<End>
Thanks for caring, Matthew.
You're a good kid.<End>
Thank you, for caring about Emma.<End>
Please let us know if you find anything.<End>
Six days have passed...
Where has the time gone...<End>
Matthew...
I know you're worried about Emma, but
don't do anything dangerous.<End>
I'm a father too, so I know how Steve
feels. I just hope Emma's found safe
and sound.<End>
I wonder how the investigation's going.
I'd like to help if I can...<End>
I just want to see that girl home safe...
<End>
A burglar, how frightening.
Does it have something to do with Emma?<End>
It's getting late...<End>
I should head home.<End>
Matthew...
Thank you for coming today.<End>
...Good night, Sarah.<End>
