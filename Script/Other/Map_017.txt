Let's go.<End>
Hurry and open it!<End>
So? Is anything inside?<End>
A disposable camera.

And... 
a floppy disk?<End>
A disk?
 Why would Emma have...<End>
There's nothing else in here.<End>
We can get the camera's pictures
developed at the camera shop in the
central square.<End>
But what about the disk?

I don't think Emma even had a
computer...<End>
Maybe it's not meant to be used in a
computer, but something else?<End>
We'll find out if we try putting it in a
computer, I guess.

Where can I find a computer?<End>
Let's go to the classroom.<End>
What's wrong?<End>
It feels like so long ago since Emma last
sat here...<End>
<End>
Did you hear about the rumour that
someone strangled Kathy?<End>
Yeah, it might be a murder.<Unk70><End>
Hearing that rumour only made me more
convinced that Emma and Kathy were
together that night...<New>

One girl gets killed, and the other goes
missing the same day...

that can't be a coincidence...<End>
Huh? Then... it might be a murder?!<End>
I don't know... hearing that rumour only
made me more convinced that Emma and
Kathy were together that night...<New>

One girl gets killed, and the other goes
missing the same day...

that can't be a coincidence...<End>
Winona...<End>
I'm sorry...
 here I am getting all
depressed...<End>
Even if Kathy was murdered, <Unk70>we have to
keep believing that Emma's alive.<End>
Yeah...<End>
And anyway, I can't find any correlations
between Emma and Kathy.

If they were acquainted,
 then why<New>
wouldn't you or I know about it?<End>
That's true...<End>
Shall we head back now?<End>
Did you get your notebook?<End>
Huh? Oh, heh heh. 
That was obviously
a lie! 'll just say it wasn't where I
thought it would be.<End>
And I thought you were supposed to be
so trustworthy.<End>
Matthew? Where are you?!
I'm here!<End>
It's almost 6pm... students have to leave
now.<End>
...<End>
Hmm, guess I'd better go.<End>
You got the
Disposable Camera<End>
You got the
Floppy Disk<End>
