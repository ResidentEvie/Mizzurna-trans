I can't sleep now.
Maybe I should take a shower before
Winona comes over.<End>
A photo of Emma, Winona and me when
we went camping.<End>
Emma really wasn't her usual self last
night. I can't exactly describe it, but she
seemed so alone...<End>
I wonder what's happened to her?<End>
Books by Shakespeare, Goethe, etc.
I didn't buy these.
My dad bought them all for me.<End>
"To be, or not to be?"
...How come it opened at that page?<End>

I guess I don't need this now.<End>
There's a notebook inside.<End>
I have to go and meet up with Winona
now, though.
It's not like I'm gonna need this.<End>
Empty cans are lined up for airgun
practice. Nozz got me started with
shooting, and I'm totally into it now.<End>
Hmm, no letters right now.<End>
Huh? Looks like I've got a letter.<End>
Huh? Looks like I've got a letter.
It's a postcard showing the Statue of
Liberty... Hmm, Dad?<End>
It's from Isabella!<End>
Matthew
Thanks for the other night.<End>
Your kindness has restored some of my
faith in humanity.<End>
So don't worry.
I can take care of myself somehow.<End>
I've included my song with this letter.<End>
I wonder why Emma liked the song
so much...
Anyway, have a listen.<End>
I don't know if there's any connection
between the song and her
disappearance, though...<End>
Also, don't come to my place again.
I'll contact you.<End>
Matthew...
it's been so long since I've felt any
human kindness...<End>
Isabella...<End>
You got the
tape of "Eternal"<End>

All right, all right.<End>
Uncle's not around, right...?<End>
This could come in handy at some point.

PROLOGUE
The story begins<End>
December 25th, 8:11 am<End>
...Hello?<End>
Matthew?<End>
...Winona, is that you?<End>
Yes.<End>
Why are you calling me this early?<End>
I just got a phone call from Sarah...
I think something's happened to Emma.<End>
Winona, calm down.<End>
Emma's mom called me...
and asked me if I knew where Emma is.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
I don't know...
but she hasn't seen Emma since
last night.<End>
Last night, you said?<End>
...Why, did something happen?<End>
...No, it's nothing.<End>
Anyway, let's meet up and talk about this.<End>
Emma's been strange lately, don't you
agree?
I'm so worried about her...<End>
It's okay. Don't worry.<End>
Okay... well, I'm coming over now.
Sarah's voice was shaking like crazy.
I wonder if something bad happened<New>
to Emma...<End>
This was taken this summer,
when Emma, Winona and I had that
barbecue...<End>
If Emma was a normal kind of girl
Winona wouldn't be this worried
about her.<End>
Emma doesn't have many friends, and
sometimes you just don't know what
she's thinking.<End>
Just like last night...<End>
Last night Emma really did seem
different. When I tried to talk to her,
she was a million miles away.<Unk70><End>
But still... She looked so beautiful.
She looked more beautiful than ever
last night.<End>
I wonder if something's happened to
her...<End>
Emma seemed so happy, back then.<End>
I wonder if something's happened
to Emma...<End>
That's enough, Rodriguez! Behave!<End>
Oh, you were so cute when you were
little, as well!<End>
Why are dog years different to human
years? In the same year, you age so
much faster than me. So strange.<End>
Man...
You have no idea what's going on right
now, do you?<End>
What?<End>
It's a postcard showing the Statue of
Liberty...
Hmm, Dad?<End>
Dear Matthew
So now you're 18 years old. Time flies!
You'll graduate from high school soon<New>
and go out into the world.
I'm sorry we couldn't live together as a
family, but the reason I didn't bring you<New>
to New York is because I wanted you to
live in the town I was born and raised in.
The sights and sounds of a good childhood<New>
will be with you for the rest of your life,
after all. I'm grateful to Uncle Nozz for
taking you under his guardianship.<New>
I know that it was tough for you when
you were a kid, but I'm sure this has
helped you grow and mature in a way<New>
other kids your age haven't.
All I want is for you to find your own
path in life.<New>
You have your whole life ahead of you
and so much to look forward to.
I believe in you, my son, but my one<New>
warning is not to believe only in what
you can see. I think you'll understand
what I mean.<New>
Never forget that your mother and I
love you very much.<End>
It's true that things were rough when I
was younger, but I really love this town.
When I was a kid, this town was my<New>
whole world. Even though it's such a
small town... As I get older, the world
just seems to get bigger...<End>
Matthew!
Come into the store for a moment.<End>
Good morning Matthew.
Sorry to bother you this early in the
morning.<End>
You don't like shaking hands?<End>
Is this about Emma?<End>
Oh, so you've already heard.<End>
Did something happen to Emma?<End>
We received a call from Emma's mother
asking us to search for her.
Any ideas?<End>
No...
I saw Emma last night, but she seemed
different from usual...<End>
In what way?<End>
I can't really explain it well, but...<Unk70><End>
She's probably just at a friend's place.
What's all the fuss about?<End>
In Emma's case, it's just a search
request, but...<End>
What are you talking about?<End>
Do you know Kathy Flannery?<End>
Flannery...?
Father Barton's girl?<End>
Oh, that fanatical Father Barton's
acolyte?
Little Miss Church?<End>
We're not in the same year at school so
I've never really spoken to her.
Has something happened to Kathy?<End>
She was found badly injured in Barrows
Forest around 6am this morning.<End>
The atmosphere changed in an instant.
No one who lives in this town could ever
expect this.<End>
Alive, but lifeless... Cohen found her
unconscious. If he'd have been even a
few minutes later it might have<New>
been too late.<End>
What happened?!<End>
She seems to have been attacked by
a bear...<End>
A bear!!! It must have failed to go into
hibernation.
They get violent when that happens.<End>
Hold on a minute! Why was she in the
forest? And has this got something to do
with Emma?<End>
It's only natural to make that
assumption. But we don't have much
of anything to go on just yet.<New>
Plus, the suspicious thing about
Kathy is...<End>
Hey, Morgan! You need the bear caught,
right?
I'm your guy! Leave it to Nozz!<End>
...In any case, can you come to the
sheriff's department? We can talk in
more detail there.<End>
Okay. I'm curious about all this, too.<End>
I'll be waiting in the car.<End>
Uncle, when Winona gets here can you
tell her I've gone to the sheriff's
department?<End>
Sure.
What a mess this all is...<End>
Matthew, there you are.
Doctor James has come especially to see
you.<End>
Hey. Sorry to just turn up unannounced.<End>
James... is there something you want
with me?<End>
No, nothing in particular. I just thought
I'd lend you that book on the ritual.<End>
I see. Let's go to my room.<End>
All right.<End>
I'll put the book here.<End>
Hmm, aren't you reading some quite
difficult books, here?<End>
I'm not particularly interested in history.
My father bought them all for me.<End>
I like history.<End>
I see.<End>
Your sense of values is very modern.<End>
However, modern values are built upon
the values of yesteryear.<End>
And the values of yesteryear, were built
upon values from even further back.<End>
By educating oneself on human history,
you can enjoy the knowledge of a
thousand lifetimes.<End>
You're as difficult to understand as
ever.<End>
That's because I think difficult thoughts.<End>
Anyway, how's Isabella?<End>
She still hasn't regained consciousness.<End>
I see.<End>
Isabella... I think that whoever comes to
visit her, will be someone vital to this
case.<End>
If I was the criminal, I wouldn't let
Isabella linger on without finishing
her off.<End>
I guess you're right.<End>
Well, there's a deputy on guard outside
her room, so I'm sure there's no need
to worry.<End>
I guess I'll go back to the hospital.
See you then.<End>
Thanks for the book.<End>
Cigarettes should do for Barbara's
birthday present.<End>
Which ones should I choose...<End>
'Blue in the Face'... yes, these are a
popular brand. Let's go with these.<End>
I didn't know you smoked.<End>
No, I'm still a minor.<End>
There's this persistent old lady at the
hospital. These are for her.<End>
Oh, Barbara? She's a heavy smoker.<End>
You know her?<End>
Yeah, well. I kinda feel sorry for her.
Have to make allowances for her,
considering.<End>
Why, what happened to her?<End>
I shouldn't be gossiping. It happened
over forty years ago, after all.<End>
Forty years ago?<End>
Pretend I didn't say anything.<End>
You got
Cigarettes<End>
So, if there's no link between Emma and
Kathy, then Emma must be missing for
a completely different reason...<End>
Bears, at this time of year... and who
knows if there's a madman on the loose,
too. Dangerous times.<End>
Just off on a quick bear hunt!
Oh how I do love messing about in
the forest.<End>
I knew it, I knew a bear was about.
Shotgun time.
Or should I bring my customised gun?<End>
Matthew, check your mailbox more often.
Don't let it get jammed with mail like
last time.<End>
There may be more bears about.
I should tool up my guns a little more.
Hmm...
<End>
I wanna tinker with my guns.
First, get that part, and then...
Mumble mumble...
<End>
I think there's more out there in the
forest. Maybe even another bear.
Oh, how I'd enjoy that...<End>
If I'm gonna tool up my gun...
I'll need to order special parts...
Mumble mumble...
<End>
Man, I wanna tinker with my guns.
Oh how I love hunting.<End>
Help me out in the shop occasionally,
willya? It's the least you could do, lodger
buddy. No mooching!<End>
Man, my shoulders are stiff lately!
I wanna get out hunting and loosen up.<End>
I feel like another hunt's in order.
I can sense a presence in the woods.
Yep, I smell another bear...<End>
Come help in the store without me
asking occasionally, ok? Hah, just
kidding.I know you pull your weight.<End>
I'm on standby. Any bears show up, and
Nozz is ready for action. Call me if you
spot anything odd in the forest.<End>
Man, I wish I could get my hands on a
bazooka.
BOOM!<End>
This yard's a mess.<End>
This is your front yard, Matthew.
How about keeping it a little neater?<End>
Man, my stiff shoulders...
mm...<End>
My shoulders get so stiff these days.
I wanna go hunting and blow off the
cobwebs.<End>
Let me know if you spot anything in the
forest. I have a feeling a new bear's
on the prowl.<End>
I won't let any young'uns out-hunt ME!<End>
Matthew, don't let your guard down.
That forest is lousy with bears!
I smell 'em!<End>
Such horrible things keep happening...<End>
I see how things are.
That bear's got people going all
crazy-like.<End>
Any news on another bear sighting?
I'm ready to roll whenever.<End>
Any bears show up, I'll pop a cap
between their eyes!<End>
Gah, is there no cure for the misery
of my stiff shoulders?<End>
Guess I'm gettin' old...
Sigh...<End>
Man...
What's next, zombies?
I don't mind going on a zombie hunt.<End>
Strange...
I'd prefer it if a bear showed up, gave
me somethin' to shoot at.<End>
Fistfighting's all about evading hits.
Let your opponent exert himself, then
strike!<New>
Helpful advice, eh?<End>
Did I ever tell you about the time I took
down a rampaging bull with only a
butter knife?<New>
My past's full of heroic deeds, ya know.<End>
Guess the year's almost over...
In the new year, I'll teach you
self-defense.<New>
I learned jiu-jitsu in Brazil when I was
younger.
Now I'll pass my skills on to you.<End>
You haven't helped in the shop in ages.
Well, no time like the present. Grab an
apron and get behind the register.<End>
You might find out some clues
if you go to Kathy's funeral.<End>
Just a spot of shopping.
Where are you going, Matthew?<End>
I was just chatting to your uncle.
He's such a funny man.<End>
This is a great shop.
Sells so many things.
And it's always fun chatting with Nozz.<End>
I'll do whatever I can to help Emma.<End>
Matthew, I hope you're showing your
uncle proper respect. You should help
out with the store sometimes.<End>
Is this your uncle's store?
Seems like you sell everything here.<End>
Guess I should rest up a little.<End>
1 hour nap
5 hour snooze
Never mind<End>

I have to close up shop soon, Matthew.
Tomorrow's gonna be another early
start.<End>
Okay.<End>
It's closed... looks like Nozz isn't around.<End>
I'm looking for something to decorate
my living room.<End>
This shop sells all kinds of things,
doesn't it?
I only came in to buy a lighter, though.<End>
Erm...
I wonder where the cigarettes are?<End>
