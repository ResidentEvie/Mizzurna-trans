Is nobody here?<End>
Guess no one would be here at this
time...<End>
No response...<End>
Is Cohen out?<End>
Still asleep, maybe?<End>
It's late... already asleep, maybe?<End>
Matthew...
Later, okay?<End>
Good night.
Matthew...
Later, okay?<End>
Don't come here again!<End>
Honestly...
What?! What now?!<End>
Stop hanging about, get lost!<End>
Hi, Matthew.
 What's up?<End>
Matthew...
Thank you for coming...<End>
Ugh, it's you...
What do you want?<End>
Hmm? You want something with me?<End>
Oh, Matthew...
What are you doing here at this hour?<End>
...Anyway, just come on in.<End>
Go ahead.<End>
Hi there!!!<End>
...<End>
Matthew!
Grouver Hospital!<End>
Hello?<End>
Matthew?<End>
Yes, Morgan?<End>
Yeah... where are you, right now?<End>
I'm...
Has something happened?<End>
We... we found Emma.<End>
?!
Is...<End>
Is she all right?!<End>
Just... come to the forest.
All right?<End>
Yes!

...I'll be right there!<End>
December 31st, 11:41 PM
Emma's body was discovered
 in Barrows
Forest.<End>
Time of death: 11:30 PM.<End>
According to Morgan, she was
discovered 
collapsed against the big
tree.<New>
Her expression was said to be
"peaceful".<End>
The autopsy revealed that, prior to her
death, she had ingested a drug with
hallucinogenic properties.<End>
Her neck showed signs of strangulation.<End>
The state police are treating her death

as a homicide and have requested
 the
intervention of the FBI.<End>
Emma was alive the whole time, but I
wasn't able to save her...<End>
Who could have strangled her?<End>
Now I feel like everything I tried to do
was pointless...<End>
I wish I could go back to the 24th again...
To the last time I felt her close to me...<End>
Hey, Matthew...<End>
If you're leaving, could you give me a
ride home?<End>
Take Winona home
Say no<End>
Thank you.<End>
Sorry...
I still have some stuff to do.<End>
Wow... that's pretty cold of you...<End>
Hee hee, just kidding.
I can walk home, don't worry about it.<End>
What?
You've decided to take me home?<End>
Weren't you going to take me home?<End>
Ugh, forget it!
I'll go home on my own!<End>
I can just walk home.
It's not far.<End>
Thanks for the ride.
You remember where I live, right?<End>
Matthew, I'm sorry.
I have to get home.
<End>
Huh?<End>
I have something I have to do.
Sorry.
See you tomorrow.<End>
Winona, do you have any idea what this
key is for?<End>
It's a locker key, isn't it?<End>
What locker?<End>
The lockers at school.<End>
...Oh, right! I knew I'd seen it somewhere
before.<End>
What's with the key, anyway?<End>
I found it in Emma's room and just
borrowed it. If we check her locker,
we might find some clues.<End>
Really! Then, I'll go with you!<End>
Oh, but actually, can we do it later?
I have stuff going on right now.<End>
Let's go to school!<End>
Okay!<End>
If we check the school, we might find
some clues.<End>
Yes?<End>
Matthew...?<End>
?! Isabella! It's Isabella, isn't it!
Where are you?<End>
My... my ring... if you show it...<End>
What?! I can't hear you!
What about a ring?<End>
Matthew... please...<End>
Isabella!
...<End>
She hung up... What's this about a ring?<End>
"Emma's Diary"

Which entry will you read?<End>
December 21st (Thursday)
December 22nd (Friday)
December 23rd (Saturday)<End>
December 21st (Thursday)<End>
"Liz doesn't understand how I feel."<End>
"I don't know what's right and what's
wrong."<End>
"What are we even alive for?
Whenever I think about it,
my head hurts."<End>
"I'm all...
alone..."<End>
"Winona seems worried about me."<End>
"But if she knew the real me...
No... I don't want to think about it..."<End>
It's just like James said...
there was a whole other Emma I never
knew...<End>
I had no idea how she was feeling... <End>
December 22nd (Friday)<End>
"Isabella seemed so sad tonight."<End>
"Her singing fills my heart with both
sadness and joy..."<End>
"But there's no light in her life.
She's being controlled by that man..."<End>
"Isabella needs help..."<End>
Isabella...<End>
There has to be some connection
between her and Emma's
disappearance...<End>
Isabella needs help... what on earth
does that mean?<End>
December 23rd (Saturday)<End>
"I feel depressed when I think about how
I have to meet Mel at 9:00."<End>
"Kathy says we need "it", but I don't
want to depend on that kind of thing."<End>
"I just want to feel some sense
of relief..."<End>
So Emma and Kathy WERE connected!
They knew each other! But what's this
thing that Kathy said they needed?<New>
And they both met Mel at 9:00
on the 23rd? But... where?<End>
There's a meeting, so I'm off to the
church. We're going to start searching
the forest.<End>
Some of the town elders are going to
search the whole forest.
If it was really a bear that mauled Kathy,<New>
then we need to take care of the
problem.<End>
I'm going to meet with Cohen to discuss
tomorrow.
We have to do something about the bear.<End>
I'm going with Cohen's hunch on the bear.
You should talk to him if you have any
questions.<End>
Nozz's apartment is falling to bits.
Everyone in town calls it "The Ruins".<End>
I need to do some deep thinking.
I'll be in my office for a while.<End>
I'm exhausted.
Another early start tomorrow.
I'd better head home.<End>
The bear hunt is about to start.
You want to come? No, no, it's too
dangerous.<New>
No point coming, I won't let you past!<End>
We caught the bear, but we can't rest
easy yet.
There's still too much we don't know.<End>
I'm going for a steak.
I need to keep up my stamina,
or I'll never solve this case.<End>
I just filled up on steak.
You should keep yourself strong too,
Matthew.<End>
Something's happened at Sarah's.
I have to head over there ASAP.<End>
I'm going to talk to the eyewitnesses.
If you notice anything, come and tell me.<End>
Tell me anything you find out about
Emma.
No matter how insignificant it seems.<End>
I'm beat.
Matthew, you should go home, too.
It's late.<End>
Gotta keep up my stamina.
I'm going to eat a steak the size of
my head.<End>
What an embarrassment.
A burglary at the diner,
and right in front of my very eyes!<End>
I have to check something.
I'm going to Dennis's.<End>
Hmm...
Have to marshal my thoughts...<End>
Is Lorraine all right?
I may go check on her. And have lunch,
of course.<End>
If you find any clues,
bring them to me immediately.<End>
Sigh...
This is no good...
I've got to get it together...<End>
I hope we get a break in the case today.<End>
Matthew, are you eating properly?
You should be eating five times a day
at your age.<End>
I'm doing my best for Emma's case.
I won't leave any stones unturned.<End>
I'm going to Astin Farm to gather info.<End>
I'm going to the bar to gather info.
No, I'm not going there for a drink...<End>
I've still got work.
You head on home.
...Not that you'll listen to me.<End>
Don't wander around at night.
Head straight home.
...Ah, it's not like you'll listen, anyway.<End>
I know you're worried about Emma,
But don't go wandering around town
at night.<End>
I'm gonna go get breakfast.
Join me?<End>
It's the sixth day of the case...
I'll find Emma. I'm staking my reputation
on it.<End>
Sigh...
Tomorrow's the last day of the year...
I'm going to find Emma safe and sound...<End>
What are you up to so early?
Can't relax?
I'd like to kick back and take in a movie...<End>
Have you eaten?
Can't work on an empty stomach.<End>
I'm going to correlate the case
information.
Come to me with any news.<End>
I have to head to the hospital.
Hmm? No, I'm in perfect health.
I have to gather some information.<End>
I want to watch that movie...
And after I got the tickets, too...
Guess I shouldn't complain...<End>
Something's bugging me.
I'm going to Astin Farm to do some
digging.<End>
Something's up there...
Those people at Wolves...<End>
Look at the time.
I have to solve this case somehow.<End>
There's something in the forest.
My intuition as a police officer
tells me so.<End>
There's something in the forest.
Nozz thinks it's another bear, but I don't.<End>
I'm going to gather info on Isabella.
Come to me with any news.<End>
I'll be at the bar, gathering info.
<End>
What are you doing loitering around
here? Go home if you don't want to
spend the night in the cells!<End>
I have to talk to Steve.
I want to know how Sarah is.<End>
Cohen's very anxious about the forest.
I think there's something in there, too...<End>
I'm heading to the hospital to check on
something.
Retracing my steps.<End>
Matthew...
Come to me with any news, no matter
how small.<End>
I'm going to canvass witnesses at Astin
Farm.
I know they're hiding something.<End>
I'm heading to Wolves to check on 
something. A bit later, though.
Matthew, you be careful.<End>
I'm going to correlate the case
information.
Something's bugging me...<End>
The forest feels strange.
I'll be there for a while.<End>
I'm going to the church.
There's a meeting to discuss what
happened this morning.<End>
We'll be searching the forest.
We're meeting at the hut at 3:30.
.
.
.I'm ready for battle!<End>
I'm off bear-hunting.
Oh, don't worry about me! I know the
forest like the back of my hand.<End>
Those bear footprints were huge.
It's clearly a massive brute.
Can't wait for tomorrow.<New>
I'm gonna pop that bear right between
the eyes!<End>
Weird for a bear to be about this time
of year. They get cranky when they
don't get to hibernate.<New>
Dangerous brutes...<End>
Morgan's so lax.
I suggested using one my special gun
mods against the bear, but noooooo.<End>
All righty! The morning has finally come!
That bear is mine!
You should be there for the bear hunt!<End>
That bear! Ferocious. Never seen such a
big one. Man, I really should have been
a huntsman.<End>
That bear had massive paws!
Haven't seen such a big one in a while.
...Hmm, yes...<End>
What are you doing?
Be a good boy and head on home.<End>
I should tool up my guns some more.
There may be more bears
 around who've
missed their bedtime.<End>
I still think there's something in that
forest. Maybe another bear.
Ah, it's just my hunch. But, you know...<New>
I have a sixth sense for this kinda thing.<End>
Still out playing? I don't really min
what you do, but it's late.
Head on home to bed.<End>
I feel... unsatisfied...
I need to go hunting again.<End>
What are you doing out on a night like
this? Still playing around?
How about studying for once?<End>
This town has its share of bad folk.
You be careful.<End>
If you find out anything,
you should let Morgan know right away.
Okay?<End>
This case gives me a bad feeling.
I know you're worried about Emma.
But don't get in too deep.<End>
Helping with the case is all well and
good.
But don't act rashly.<End>
It's not safe out at this time.
Go home like a good boy.
All right?<End>
You're still in high school.
You can't just run all over town at night.
Go home like a good boy.<End>
An early morning walk?<End>
If you need anything, I'm always around.<End>
I have some business with Morgan.<End>
The investigation is stalling.
All this worry over Emma...<End>
I still have to check some things, so stay
away from the forest.<End>
I still need to do some deep thinking,
about the forest...<End>
You should head home.<End>
It's dangerous. Go on home.<End>
Anything bothering you?<End>
What's up?
You can confide in me.<End>
There's a library book I wanted to read.<End>
I feel so run down.
Yeah, I'll stop by the hospital.
Thanks for your concern.<End>
How was the forest during my
absence...?
I feel responsible for it...<End>
I've got a bad feeling...
Matthew, are you all right?<End>
They must be searching the forest for
Emma around now...
I wonder what's happening.<End>
I think I'll go for lunch now.
I want to talk to Lorraine, too.<End>
The forest search is over for today...
I wonder if they found Emma?
I'm going to see Morgan.<End>
I wonder if Sarah is feeling any better
yet... I'm so worried about her.
I need to think... I'm going to the park.<End>
I'm so worried about Emma.
Let's do whatever we can to help
search, okay?<New>
If you need me, I'll be at my house.<End>
I wonder what Emma is doing now...if
she misses everyone... I can't stand
thinking about that...<End>
I can't relax at home.
I'm going to drop by the park first
to think.<End>
The more I think about all this, the less
it makes sense.
I didn't know Emma at all...<End>
If we go to Kathy's funeral,
we might find out some clues.<End>
Kathy... was there something between
her and Emma? I want to know...
I have to go to the cemetery.<End>
I'm going to the sheriff's department for
an update on the case.
If I find anything out, I'll let you know.<End>
I'm worried about Sarah's condition.
She was so distraught yesterday...
maybe she's a little better today?<New>
I'm going to go and see.<End>
I'm worried about Sarah.
Is she going to be all right?<End>
Poor Sarah...
I wonder who the burglar is?<End>
This wind is freezing, Matthew.
I think we should head home.<End>
Morning, Matthew. I feel better after a
good sleep. I'm going to the lake now.
If you need me, come there.<End>
This wind is chilling me to the bone.
Aren't you cold, Matthew?<End>
I'm curious about that book Emma
was reading...<End>
I'm going to the boat house.
Let me know if you find anything new.
See you.<End>
I want to buy something at the store.
I guess I'll chat with Nozz while I'm at it.<End>
I came to borrow a book.
And I wanted to talk to Liz, too.<End>
I can't stay out too late. I have to head
home.
Call me if anything comes up.<End>
I'll be in the library.
Thanks for saying hi.
You're always so... nice, Matthew.<End>
Uncle Nozz is very funny!
I'll be stopping by to chat with him again
soon.<End>
Did you find out anything about Emma?
I'm going to the sheriff's department.<End>
You're such a nice guy, Matthew.
Somehow, I feel calmer whenever
I see your face...<End>
It's so late...
Thanks for worrying about me...
Call me if anything comes up.<End>
I want to go to the park and think.
I know it worries people, but...<End>
Thank you for being my friend, Matthew.
Sorry to bother you...
I just wanted to talk to you...<End>
I'll be at the hospital for a while.
Call me if anything comes up.<End>
I want to ask Wolf something at the bar.
I'm not going to touch alcohol, though.<End>
Shut up!
Quit tryin'a talk to me!!!
I ain't interested in talkin' to you.<End>
Leave me alone!
You're pissin' me off! Get lost!<End>
What the hell do you want?
You stalkin' me or somethin'?!
You make me sick.<End>
Leave me alone!
I ain't got nothin' to say to you!<End>
It's a free country!
I can go where I want!
I don't gotta tell you nothin'!<End>
I'm going to the diner!
You got a problem with that?<End>
I'm goin' where I WANT to go.
Don't even think of followin' me!<End>
Leave me alone.
I ain't got nothin' to do with Emma!<End>
You're a pain in the ass!
I'm in a hurry here!<End>
I'm just havin' a drink at the bar!
Quit judgin' me.
<End>
Quit talkin' to me!
It's late! You're freakin' me out.<End>
Pah!<End>
I'm feelin' good right now.
Don't kill my buzz, man.<End>
I wanna ride my bike right on into that
sheriff's department.<End>
None of your business where I'm goin'!
Quit stalkin' me.<End>
I can do what I like!
I don't hafta explain myself to you!<End>
So, I got collared by that pig.
Havin' yourself a good laugh?
*spit*<End>
Shit!
I can see you laughin' at me!<End>
Tch... I don't wanna see your smug face.<End>
Matthew... you think my father killed
himself, too?
Shit!!!<End>
That pig called me in again.
Screw everything!!!<End>
Hmph! Stop followin' me!
It's a free country! I can go where I like!<End>
I have to talk to Lorraine!
Get lost, I ain't got no business with you.<End>
What are you, a cop?
Quit interrogatin' me!
What's it to you if I have a drink, huh?<End>
It's none of your business where I sleep!
Quit investigatin' me!<End>
Stop following me!!!
You wanna suck on my fist, huh?!<End>
Why do I gotta go runnin' whenever that
pig calls me?!
Gives me a headache.<End>
Sheriff Piggy Morgan really pisses
me off.
You too, Matthew.<End>
Leave me alone.
I ain't got nobody now.
So just leave me be.<End>
The year's up.
I'd rather be talkin' to anyone
but you right now. Bye.<End>
Winona seems so put-together, but I
know she's suffering inside.
Matthew, be her friend, won't you?<New>
Just listen to her when she wants
to talk.<End>
I'm sorry... I have to go visit my
grandmother now. If you want to talk
about Emma, let's do it another time.<End>
Don't go outside late at night.
It's not safe, not until this case has
been solved.<New>
Go home for today, okay?<End>
Matthew... There's a curfew, you know.
Living by yourself at your age means
you have to be disciplined.<End>
I have work now.
Why don't you come study at the library
sometime?<End>
Matthew...
I wonder how Winona is doing?
She keeps everything all bottled up.<End>
I need to think...
I'm sorry.
Matthew...<End>
I go to church regularly. I'm not trying
to push religion on you, but why don't you
come and pray sometime, too?<End>
I'm going to visit my grandmother now.
She's a good person, really.
A lot of people don't get that about her.<End>
Go home, please.
It's not safe at night.
And it's better to be safe than sorry.<End>
You're still out?
There's a curfew, you know.
Go home, Matthew.<End>
It's nice to be up early!
Don't you agree, Matthew?<End>
Good morning, Matthew!
You always seem so well. I'm glad.<End>
It's tiring visiting my grandmother at
the hospital every day. You should come
and visit sometimes, too.<End>
Oh, hello Matthew.
I was deep in thought; I didn't spot
you there.<End>
Matthew, please be careful. I've seen
you bash into walls with that car of
yours. Please drive carefully.<New>
I already have one person in hospital I
have to visit. Matthew, you can come
and visit with me if you like.<End>
Matthew, I've seen you driving in the
middle of the road.
Please obey traffic rules.<End>
Good morning, Matthew. It's gonna be a
brand new year from tomorrow.
But I can't get excited somehow.<End>
I just keep thinking about Emma...

It's almost been a full week now...<End>
I have to do some shopping.
Nozz's store has all kinds of products.
It's very convenient.<End>
I go to visit my grandmother
every single day.
She's important to me.<End>
I wonder how Emma's case is developing.
I have to ask Morgan for an update.<End>
There's a meeting at the church.
I wonder what will be discussed.
It seems very important...<End>
There's a search of the forest going on
now. I'd like to help Morgan and the
other officers any way I can.<End>
As a father of a daughter myself,
this case really upsets me.
I hope it comes to a resolution soon.<End>
What a horrible incident.
I hope Morgan and Hudson can sort this
out quickly.<End>
Listen, Matthew. I'd like you to head
straight home. I know you're almost a
man, but it's dangerous at night.<End>
I don't want Winona walking around
town.
Not until this case is resolved.<End>
Bears, burglars...
What's going on in this town?
This town... it's...<End>
Winona's completely down.
I'm worried about her.
I just want her to be herself again...<End>
Winona is the same age as Emma and
Kathy were. I won't rest easy until this
case is sorted out.<End>
Matthew, I'll give you a free tank of gas.
In exchange, please watch out for
Winona.<End>
I hear you're assisting with the
investigation.
Don't do anything dangerous.<End>
I feel better when Winona's safe at
home.<End>
I just want Winona to cheer up...
She's just not herself...<End>
There's a meeting at the church now.
You're just a kid, so you can't attend,
I'm afraid.<End>
Kathy's dead...
Emma's missing...
It's all awful.<End>
I envy you young kids.
Off to have fun?
If only I was 10 years younger.<End>
You're up early.
Me? 
*yaaAAawwWn* ...I'm sleepy.<End>
*yaaAAawwWn*
Work's finally over.
I want to do something fun.<End>
It's gonna be another cold one today.
Ugh, it's freezing!
Come see me if you catch a cold.<End>
Off for hijinks?
Ah, young kids today.
I envy you all.<End>
*yaaAAawwWn* Ugh, can't stop yawning.
By the way...
Do you know any cute chicks?<End>
The year's about to end.
Please, let me have a woman next year!<End>
I'm going to the bar to get my drink on.
Ah alcohol, my old friend.<End>
Having some evening fun?
You're a sprightly young man, eh?
Well, good night.<End>
Come see me when you have a spare
moment. Don't hold back.
Come to me with any worries.<End>
I have to check something at the library.
Reading is important.
I'll lend you a book some time.<End>
No, I'm not skipping work.
I'm not the head doctor.
Hahaha, forget I said that.<End>
I'll be having a drink at the bar again 
tonight. If I don't have my evening drink,
it feels like I haven't finished work.<End>
It's quite late.
I'll be heading home.
Aren't you going home, too?<End>
I have to check something at the library.
Hmm? It's for my research.<End>
You want to know what I'm doing now?
I'm going to investigate something that's
been on my mind.<End>
Good night, I'm quite tired.
Staying up too late will mean a tough
start tomorrow.<End>
Good morning! Did I sound convincingly
awake? I think I drank too much last
night. You seem fine though, Detective.<End>
I intend to spend the day in research.<End>
I hope I can make some progress today.<End>
Sigh...
It's just so obscure...
Huh? Oh, just talking about my research.<End>
It's a full moon tonight.<End>
And the year's ending...<End>
*mumble* *mumble*<End>
What?
Don't follow me.<End>
You've got a cell phone, haven't you?
Don't use it while you're driving,
it's not safe.<New>
If you get a call while driving,
pull over before answering.<End>
You drive, right? Watch your gas gauge.
When the meter reaches 0, your speed
will plummet.<End>
Darn, I should have picked up one of
those maps from the sheriff
department's floor.<New>
I just got to town, and I don't know
where anything is.<End>
I travel to many towns across the
country. When you're just passing
through, it's hard to find the good<New>
places in town. I just hop in my car and
drive around. I usually find at least one
cool joint that way.<End>
Evening! I'm off to bed.
I just got to this town.
I don't know where anything is.<New>
I'm gonna drive around town tomorrow
and acclimate myself.<End>
What? Did you want something?
Is there something on my face?<End>
I look grumpy? Well, yeah, I am.
You would be too, if you got stood up
for a hot date!!!<End>
I'm gonna go home.
I'm exhausted.<End>
Isn't the telephone amazing? You can
find out where anyone is, simply by
calling them!<New>
An amazing invention.
The telephone really saves a bunch
of time and legwork.<End>
Hello.
It's sunny today, but it's still freezing.<End>
Hello.
Looks like snow again tonight.<End>
I wonder if there'll be a blizzard tonight?<End>
I feel like having a drink tonight.
Maybe I'll go to the bar.
I think it opens from 8pm.<End>
Good morning!
I came to pray!
Would you care to join me?<End>
I went to the park after dark the other
evening, and this weird old guy
challenged me to a fistfight.<New>
He was ranting about battles and how
he was gonna make a fighter outta me.
It was almost scary.<End>
Hello.
I'm off to the hospital. I'm not sick or
injured or anything, though.<End>
No good...
I got turned away at the door again
today... Oh well...<End>
Huh? Who are you?<End>
It's freezing. Who are you?<End>
I'm going to question residents.
Someone must have seen Emma.<End>
I still can't believe what's happened...
If you think of anything, come and see
me.<End>
You drive, right, Matthew?
Make sure not to get in any accidents.<End>
If you find out any information on the
case, report to Morgan or myself
at once.<End>
Don't get involved in any danger.
Be especially careful at night.<End>
Don't walk around late at night.
Don't you know there's a curfew?
<End>
There was a burglary at the Rowlands'.
I have to head over there right now.<End>
If you spot anyone suspicious,
contact us right away.<End>
This was always such a peaceful town...
We have to solve this case,
and put
things back the way they should be.<End>
A robbery just happened at the diner.
First yesterday's burglary, now this.
What the hell is going on?<End>
I'm going to look for the diner robber
now. Let me know if you spot anyone
suspicious.<End>
Matthew...
Thank you, for your concern.<End>
You're a nice boy.
I wish more young people could be
like you.<End>
Matthew.
Are you living the way you should be?
That's all part of obeying God's will.<End>
Matthew. The Lord has given me my
orders. Those sinners...
I have to save them before it is too late.<New>
I am the only one who can...<End>
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't walk around at night.
Go home at once.<End>
Have you come to pray for Kathy?
<End>
Matthew...
I strive to save the souls of sinners.
What about you?<End>
Matthew...
You shouldn't walk around at night.<End>
Matthew...
We must not lose ourselves in grief.<End>
Matthew...
The Lord has given me my orders.
Those sinners...<New>
I have to save them before it is too late.
I am the only one who can...
<End>
Matthew...
What are you doing here at this time?
Go home at once.<End>
Matthew... have you noticed some bad
folk around town recently?<End>
Matthew... do you know what your
purpose is, in life?
Why are you in a place like this?<End>
The year is almost over.
I must save the sinners...<End>
So much money.
So why won't the president rebuild?!<End>
I'm gonna let him know how I feel!
Then I'll MAKE him rebuild!
No more excuses!<End>
There's always tomorrow!
I KNOW the president will cave, and
rebuild in the end!<End>
Meeting at the church.
Pain in the ass.
Tch...<End>
Noisy busybodies.
I'm a busy man!<End>
What!
I can go where I want!
None of your business!<End>
Don't you follow me!
Tch...<End>
I'm busy! Don't talk to me!<End>
Ugh, so annoying!
Get lost!<End>
Get lost!
I don't have time to talk to you!<End>
What?! I'm not giving you any money!<End>
Ugh, what?
You think my face is funny?!<End>
Leave me alone.
Quit playing detective, it's pathetic!<End>
Quit bothering me!
Stop... investigating me!<End>
Ugh, get lost!
I don't feel so good right now.
I don't wanna talk.<End>
You again...
I'm hungover and I have a headache, 
so keep your voice down.<End>
Don't you ever quit?
I'll sic my dog on you!<End>
Hey! I feel pretty good today!
But I'm still not gonna give you any
money.<End>
Hey! What's up?
Be careful of cars!<End>
Hey! Wash your clothes for once.
How long are you gonna wear the same
ones for?<End>
Those noisy farm workers have finally
piped down.
Good.<End>
What are you looking at?
You think I'm funny?!<End>
Tch!
That stupid son of mine.
It's like he's TRYING to shame me.<End>
Huh?
None of your business where I drink.<End>
Don't follow me!
None of your business where I go!
<End>
Hmm? I seem odd?
Are you smirking at me, Matthew?<End>
I have to go. To the sheriff's department.
You want go instead?<End>
You and I have nothing to discuss.
Why do you insist on talking to me?<End>
You think you're a detective or
something? Why the hell should I
answer any of your dumb questions?<End>
Why do I have to suffer like this...<End>
Tch...
Why does nothing go the way I plan it?<End>
I don't give a damn where you go.
Do what you want.<End>
You should head home, boy.
Don't wanna get eaten by a bear, do ya?<End>
You're up late, huh.
Wouldn't you rather be tucked up in bed?<End>
.
.
.
Tch...
What?!<End>
You're up early, boy.<End>
If you don't want anything, then get lost.
Go away, go on, shoo.
<End>
I like to be alone.
Don't worry about me.<End>
You're always roaming around.
Don't you have a family?<End>
Head by the bar?
Can't serve you any alcohol, though.<End>
You're up way past your bedtime, boy.
Impressive.<End>
...
Ugh, be quiet.
I don't feel so good right now.<End>
I'm tired from work.
Sorry, but I can't chat with you right now.
Find someone else to talk to.<End>
Sorry, urgent business.
I'm in a hurry.<End>
No time to talk.
Another time.<End>
I'll get in trouble if I have kids in my bar.
Not that I mind personally, though.<End>
None of your business where I go...
Sorry...<End>
I have business.<End>
I have to work.
Don't want to be late.<End>
I'm exhausted.
Can you come another time?<End>
Exhaustion carries over to the next
day's work.
Can you let me rest?<End>
I can't be late for work.
Excuse me.<End>
I don't feel like talking right now.
Please leave me be...<End>
I have to hurry home.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.<End>
I have work.
I don't want to be late.<End>
It's none of your business where I go...
I'm sorry...<End>
I'm sorry...
I don't really have time.
Can I go now?<End>
I want to be alone to think about nothing.
I guess you wouldn't understand...<End>
Sigh...
.
.
.
I'm tired...<End>
...I'm sick of this life...
Sigh...
Oh, nothing.<End>
I can't be late for work.
Excuse me.<End>
Horrible things just keep on happening...
...That's what I keep thinking.<End>
I hate to leave Sarah alone, but I have
that town council meeting now.
The mayor has to be there...<End>
I wonder what she's doing right now...
Emma...
I'm so worried...<End>
I'll pray night and day, 
if it'll help us
find Emma.<End>
If only I'd been more attentive,
maybe this wouldn't have happened...<End>
I think Sarah needs some fresh air...<End>
Sarah always cheers up a little when
you come to visit.<End>
How horrible, a burglary at our house...
Makes me feel so... violated.<End>
I'm concerned about Sarah.
I have to hurry home.<End>
Emma...
I hope she's in good health...<End>
What is she doing right now?
Emma...
I hope she's not cold...<End>
Where could she be?
Emma...
I hope she's not suffering...<End>
I know Emma will be found.
I have faith in Morgan.<End>
I'm so grateful for your concern,

Matthew.<End>
I'm going to have a drink at the bar.
Cold days like this make me want
a drink.<End>
It's getting late, Matthew.
I'm going to head home.<End>
Just out for a walk.
Don't mind me.<End>
I need a drink.
Care to join me, Matthew?
Just kidding.<End>
Is that the time?
Aren't you tired, Matthew?
I'm going to head home.<End>
Never mind where I'm going.
Don't follow me.<End>
I drink, and I forget everything.
I feel like nothing matters anymore...<End>
I'm... so drunk.
Hmm...<End>
Sigh...
The year's almost up.
It's so cold...<End>
I feel like gazing out across the lake.
You don't think that sounds like
something I'd do?<End>
I need a drink.
Hehe...<End>
Shouldn't be out late at night!
I'm going home, you know.<End>
The last day of the year...
Can't get through without a drink...<End>
That... idiot.<End>
He's such a moron... honestly...<End>
It's the end of the year.
And I still can't figure that jerk out.<End>
Sigh...
This is our busiest time.<End>
Have you seen the noticeboards?
They're updated with the latest
developments in town.<New>
They're really informative.<End>
Oh man, I have no idea where to go next...
I'm always like this. At times like this,
I just check a map. It's all you can do.<New>
Driving around town searching for stuff
takes up so much precious time...
<End>
Hello.
Is Doctor James here?<End>

I'm off to the church.<End>
Good afternoon!
Just out for a solitary stroll.<End>

Oh, but first, I need to get gas.<End>
