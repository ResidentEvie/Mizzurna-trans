Wolf, 56<End>
Owner of Bar Wolves.<End>
Knows everything about the town's
regular patrons and the night life here.<End>
Ray lights fall from the sky<End>
Like a stream inside my life<End>
Ray lights surrounding me<End>
Telling me when I'm reborn<End>
Ray lights infinity<End>
Sacred symbols, I've seen them
somewhere<End>
The moment stops and songs<End>
Sung by the angels are heard.<End>
Ah, shit...<End>
Tch...<End>
Stupid Emma...
Where the hell have you disappeared to?<End>
Hey, Mel!
Aren't you Mr Popular this evening.<End>
Remember this.
A man always keep his promises.<End>
If you can't even do
that, what you got left, huh?<End>
Shut up. I said I got it already.<End>
No wonder Emma got away from you.<End>
Say what?!<End>
Know what I think?<End>
I think she's hiding somewhere to get
away from you, you persistent jerk.<End>
What are you talking about?<End>
Didn't you know? This guy brought Emma
here plenty of times to try to put the
moves on her.<End>
Always arguing, weren't ya?<End>
Shut up! Mind your own business!<End>
Just keep up your end of our agreement!<End>
What? Something you wanna say?<End>
What have you done to Emma!<End>
Huh? What are you...<End>
Do you have something to do with her
disappearance?!<End>
Whatever's between me and Emma is
none of your business!<End>
Now get lost!
You shouldn't be in here.<End>
I told you to go home!<End>
You bastard!<End>
Shit...
I don't have time to play with you... <End>
Matthew!<End>
Over here.<End>
Hello, Detective.
How goes the investigation?<End>
Stop with the detective thing.<End>
Just a little fun. So, how goes it?<End>
Not great... I'm sure you know more
about what's going on than I do.<End>
You sound jealous.<End>
...<End>
Why aren't you sitting at the counter?<End>
I don't like Wolf very much.
<End>
The owner.<End>
He knows everything about the
nightlife in this town. Maybe you could
get some info out of him.<End>
Excuse me...<End>
...<End>
Why don't you take a seat?<End>
Want something alcoholic? <End>
No...<End>
Don't you know anything?
If you sit at the counter, you need to
order a drink.<End>
Then, a glass of milk.<End>
Milk! Haha! Well, whatever.<End>
How much?<End>
It's on the house.
Drink that and get lost.<End>
Do you know Emma Rowland?<End>
...Emma?<End>
You know her?<End>
She comes here often.<End>
She turned a few heads, on account
of her being a beauty and all. <End>
Did anything specific happen?<End>
One time this guy was being real
persistent, so Emma stabbed him in the
thigh with a fork.<End>
Of course, the guy was in the wrong,
so nothing was made of it. <End>
Emma really did that?<End>
After that, everyone started to think
of her as this crazy girl.<End>
Did she always come here alone?<End>
Yep.
<End>
Oh, except one time she did bring
another girl with her. <End>
What did she look like?<End>
You're a bit keen to know about this.
I don't even remember.<End>
I see...<End>
Maybe Kathy...?<End>
Do you come here often?<End>
Yeah, well.<End>
I heard Samuel approached you here,
before.<End>
Samuel? <End>
The head doctor at Grouver Hospital.<End>
Oh, that old pervert? Ugh, what a creep. <End>
Was Kathy with you then?<End>
...Yeah.<End>
What about you and Kathy?<End>
I met her here.<End>
We started talking, and instantly had
a connection.
Life was dull for her, too.<End>
The Kathy I knew wasn't the kind of girl
to go out late at night...<End>
Everyone thought she was like some
kind of saint. But she was just
sixteen, you know.<End>
She wanted to have fun just like
everyone else, I think.<End>
But she had to be careful of that father
of hers.<End>
Since he raised her when she was
an orphan with nobody else, blah blah.<End>
It's true that Father Barton can be quite
severe.<End>
She must have been raised to constantly
fear his disapproving eye.<End>
She couldn't handle the pressure of
being the daughter of a church family.<End>
I see...<End>
You know, when I was here with Kathy
one time, that priest came.<End>
Kathy was terrified.<End>
Terrified?! Don't you just mean, it was
uncomfortable for her to be found out...?<End>
Yeah, I thought that at first, but later I
started to really feel that it was terror.<End>
Anyway, after that, Kathy never showed
her face here again.<End>
I wasn't expecting to see her here again
myself, either...<End>
When was the last time you saw her?<End>
On the night of the 24th.<End>
The 24th?! What time?<End>
I think it was around 9pm. I can't forget
the look on her face.<End>
It was like she was dead inside. I called
her name over and over, but she just...<End>
When she finally heard me...
you know what she said to me?<End>
...No. It's not something I should repeat,
not now.<End>
Just a moment, please.<End>
Yes.<End>
Matthew, where are you?<End>
Winona?<End>
I was curious about something to do with
Kathy, so I was thinking of going to see
Father Barton...<End>
Sorry, I'm a bit busy right now...<End>
I see... never mind, then. Bye.<End>
Wait a minute... Winona!<End>
Is something wrong?<End>
She said she was curious about
something to do with Kathy, and was
going to the church...<End>
You should stay away from that priest.<End>
I know he's a bit overly zealous, but he's
not a bad person.<End>
That's because you've never seen him
with that look in his eyes!<New>
Looking down on people with his cold,
dead eyes, like they're scum!<End>
THIS is what Kathy said to me that day:<End>
"My father killed me..."!<End>
?! What are you talking about?!<End>
I don't even know!
But I do know that he did something
to her!<End>
...Kathy had bruising on her neck, like
she'd been strangled. Do you know
anything about that?!<End>
?! I didn't know that!
Then...<End>
Oh my god! I have to go to the church!<End>
Wait! Then Kathy... <End>
Shit... I have a really bad feeling
about this...<End>
Everyone, thank you for being here at
Bar Wolves tonight.<End>
Isabella!<End>
Thank you.<End>
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't
perform this evening.<End>
Wh-wh-what?<End>
I'm very sorry, I have some personal
business to attend to.<End>
I think I'll be able to sing tomorrow
night... I'm very sorry...<End>
I'll c-come again t-tomorrow...<End>
...<End>
Hey!<End>
Do you come here every day?<End>
Well, alcohol is the elixir of life.<End>
What the...?<End>
I'm talking about whisky. Since ancient
times, humans haven't been able to live
without our alcohol.<End>
I wonder if that's true.<End>
It liberates the soul and guides us to a
higher plane of existence.<End>
That's drunk nonsense.<End>
Haha, indeed.<End>
Oh, she's about to begin!<End>
Who is she?<End>
Isabella. This bar's resident singer.<End>
Listen closely.<End>
Isabellaaaa!<End>
What do you think?
Phenomenal, isn't she?<End>
Yes.<End>
It's a marvellous song.<End>
How long has she been singing
at this bar?<End>
She came recently. Around a month ago.
She just appeared one day, like a
mysterious musical goddess.<End>
Isabellaaa!<End>
I-Isabella! Go out with me tonight!<End>
P-Please!<End>
...<End>
Wh-What are you lookin' at?!<End>
Nothing in particular.<End>
What, are you tryin' to get Isabella, too?<End>
Y-You should forget about it!
Isabella would never go for a kid
like you!<End>
You're just a kid yourself...<End>
Wh-What's that? You wanna fight?<End>
No...<End>
What, you can't even fight?
I got business with Isabella!
D-Don't try to get in my way!<End>
It seems like you're bothering her.<End>
Don't talk like you know anything, kid!
Y-You're stinkin' up the joint!<End>
Sh-Shit!<End>
Thank you, you saved me.<End>
Does this happen often?<End>
Recently, yes...<End>
Um...<End>
Do you know Emma Rowland?<End>
Emma...<End>
It seems she came to this bar often.<End>
Yes, I've met her, but...<End>
Sorry, I'm going backstage...
I want to rest...<End>
Hey! Aren't you gonna say somethin'?!<End>
Mel!<End>
Matthew! You have to stop Mel!<End>
What on earth is going on?<End>
If you've got a problem with me, I don't
really care. But keep it out of my bar! <End>
You heard him! Now get the hell out!<End>
Answer the damn question!
Where is he?<End>
Where is Bonehead hiding?
I know you know!<End>
That's about enough!<End>
Shut your face!<End>
That's enough!<End>
You jerk!<End>
Matthew! You have to stop Mel!<End>
That's far enough!<End>
Thank god. Hurry up and get this kid
out of my bar.<End>
Mel, you want to go back behind bars?<End>
Come on! What are you doing?!
This guy is...<End>
Huh?<End>
Morgan here.<End>
What?! Isabella's awake?!<End>
?!<End>
I'll swing by the station and be right
there!<End>
What's this about Isabella?<End>
It seems she's regained consciousness.<End>
Mr. Sheriff, you don't intend to let this
kid stay here, do you?<End>
Mel! You come with me.<End>
Why?<End>
I won't do anything else!
Just leave me alone.<End>
Stop talking, and come along.<End>
Shit...<End>
Matthew, let's go to the hospital, too!<End>
Yeah.<End>
We don't serve alcohol to minors.
It ain't worth the hassle.<End>
You're looking for Emma?
Well, we get a lot of customers here.<End>
You seem lively tonight.<End>
Did Mel and Emma often argue?<End>
Yeah. Don't know what about.
But Emma seemed to know his
weak point.<End>
It wasn't the other way round?<End>
Dunno. But since Emma went missing,
Mel's seemed agitated.<End>
Where's Isabella today?<End>
Isabella? She's exhausted herself.
She's taking some time off. <End>
I see...<End>
I wonder if she's at home...?<End>
What do you want with Isabella?<End>
Nothing in particular.<End>
Are you the creep who was peeking into
her apartment?<End>
...What makes you think that?<End>
Heard about it from Isabella's driver.<End>
Her driver? Now you mention it, do you
know her old driver?
Bald guy?<End>
Bonehead. I don't know the guy well,
or anything. <End>
I'd like to meet with him.<End>
And do what?<End>
...<End>
Not saying this because I give a shit
about you one way or another. But
you shouldn't get involved with him.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
He's connected to some pretty
dangerous people.<End>
What dangerous people?<End>
Scary folks.<End>
What? Didn't know a suckup kid like you
came to this bar...<End>
It seems you come here often.
Is it ok for you to be drinking alcohol?<End>
Shut up! I only drink milk here.<End>
That creeper's here again tonight.<End>
Who's that?<End>
I don't know the kid.
But he comes here every night to drool
over Isabella.<End>
Isabella doesn't seem to like it.<End>
Well, duh.
He's nuts, thinks Isabella is in love with
him.<End>
Is... she going to be okay?<End>
Yeah, probably.<End>
Isabella's got a lot to deal with.<End>
She seems to know Emma.<End>
Well, it's no doubt true that Emma took
a liking to Isabella's singing.<End>
Yeah.<End>
This is my take on it. In a few words,
you could sum up Emma as a girl
struggling with an anxious soul.<End>
Isabella's songs could be like, some kind
of drug to her that brings her a sense
of peace. <End>
...<End>
Considering Emma's personality, she
must have made the effort to reach
out to Isabella personally.<End>
It looks like I can't have a rational
conversation with Isabella.<End>
Yeah, she's pretty well-guarded
at this bar.<End>
Why don't you try following her?<End>
Following... her?<End>
I've seen her get in a car from the back
entrance.<End>
She seems to leave around just after
midnight. <End>
Just after midnight, huh...<End>
This door's off-limits.<End>
I'd like to speak with Isabella.<End>
No! Too many weird customers lately!<End>
Do they come just to speak to Isabella?<End>
Figure it out yourself.<End>
You can't go in here.<End>
Doesn't look like I'm getting through...<End>
Loretta, did you wait long?<End>
Please, take a seat?<End>
You wanna talk standing up? Sit down!<End>
Didn't your friend say she was going
to the church?! What if that priest is the
one who strangled Kathy?!<End>
Winona!<End>
I have to get to the church!<End>
Hmm?<End>
Wh-What? I've got nothin' else to say
to you!<End>
Are you thinking of stalking Isabella
again?<End>
W-Watch what you're sayin' about me!<End>
You're always scribbling stuff down.
What are you writing?<End>
N-None of your business!<End>
Show it to me.<End>
Hmm? △×○△...
Is this Isabella's phone number?<End>
N-No it ain't!<End>
You're bothering her with nuisance
calls, aren't you?!<End>
N-No, I'm not! It ain't Isabella's
phone number...<End>
D-Don't call△×○△!
It ain't Isabella's ph-phone number!<End>
What? You wanna order?<End>
You here to drink again?
Well, whatever.<End>
Coffee?

How bout something with a little more
kick?<End>
You want milk?

Well, whatever you say, kid.<End>
Sorry, no alcohol for you.
<End>
You want chips?
They're best with booze, but...
Well, your call.<End>
You drink a lot, huh?
Just nothin' with booze.<End>
What, you want more food?

My stuff's that good, huh?<End>
There!<End>
You got no money?!

This ain't a charity, kid!<End>
Changed your mind?

If you ain't drinkin', buzz off.<End>
So you're not here to drink?

Gathering intel? 
You're really not here
for booze, are you?<End>
The investigation isn't going well, is it?
Maybe one of the regulars here knew
Emma or Kathy.<End>
Personally, I think Wolf knows
something about Emma.
He never says what he really means.<End>
You keep frequenting this place,
you'll end up a delinquent like Mel!<End>
First time in a bar?<End>
From what I hear, Kathy was in and
out of this place a lot.<New>
Maybe Emma and Kathy struck up
a friendship here.<End>
Do you know Barbara, who's staying at
the hospital in a room meant for three
people?<New>
Emma came often to visit her. It seems
she was interested in Barbara's
tales of the olden days. <End>
Haven't seen Samuel in a while.
You heard the rumours? He comes here
to pick up chicks.<End>
"Not how the world is,
 but THAT it is,

is the mystery."
Emma liked this quote.<New>
She understood that the way she lived,
was not quite human.
Do you understand what I'm saying?<End>
I've thought a lot about what Emma was
struggling with. 
She believed in the
existence of things which humans can't<New>
understand.
But she also knew that those things
would not help her live.<New>
To believe in such things, is to separate
oneself from humankind.<End>
That Wolf guy is giving me dirty looks.
What a bastard. I wonder what Emma
came here for, anyway???<End>
What did you come for?

Not booze, right?<End>
Have you seen Bonehead?!
That bald monk?!
...Where the hell's he disappeared to...?<End>
What a lovely bar.
There aren't any bars like this any
more in my hometown.<New>
This place has a slightly creepy feel,
though...<End>
Emma was a troublemaker.
She stabbed a guy who was hitting
on her.<End>
There's a girl who knew Kathy.
She comes here to drink sometimes,

but she's not here tonight.<New>
Who knows when she'll show up again.<End>
I wasn't on especially friendly terms
with Emma. 
As a matter of fact, she
seemed to hate me.<New>
Not that I need a woman who's so hard
to read.<End>
Emma didn't come here to be hit on by
guys, or get wasted.
She came to hear Isabella sing.<New>
Whenever Isabella was on stage, Emma
was transfixed... She wouldn't hear a
word anyone else said to her.<End>
I know you suspect me. But I ain't hiding
nothing. You should stay away from me
if you know what's good for you.<End>
Rebuild this, refurbish that.
Go kick rocks.<New> If they come protesting again tomorrow,
how can I distract them?
Huh? What the hell do you want?<End>
Damn, everything's gone to hell.
Anyone would turn to drink.
<End>
Not a drinker, eh?
Ah, you don't know what you're missing...<End>
Stupid, ungrateful, selfish son...
Making a spectacle of himself...
No thought to how it affects me...<End>
Why all this?
Whyyy?<End>
Thank you for coming to hear me sing.
...But I'm very tired, so please come
another time.<End>
I'm sorry, I know you came just to hear
me...
I don't feel like talking.<End>
Thank you for coming to hear me sing.
It really makes me happy.
...But I need to rest today.<End>
Thank you for welcoming the new year
with me...
Thank you, for coming to hear me sing...<End>
Huh, so you come here to drink too?
Let me tell ya a secret.
There's a live performance every night<New>
here at 10:30.
It's something special, all right.
You'll fall in love.<End>
Did you come to see Isabella? Her
bodyguard is pretty strict, I doubt
you'll get to speak with her.<New>
If you're that obsessed with her, better
catch her on her way home.<New>
I've seen her leave the bar by the back
entrance at 12:30 before.<End>
Today's been hell.
That brainless... idiot...<End>
Drinking won't help...
Not in the end...<End>
Matthew, know what I think?
Drinking to forget definitely works, but
not for long.<End>
Hey, Matthew...
On closer inspection, you're kinda
handsome. Hehe, just kidding.<End>
I just don't understand him... 
Sigh...<End>
Matthew, will you stay and drink with
me?

Please...
Take pity on me...<End>
