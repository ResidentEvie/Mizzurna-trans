Thanks, Matthew.<End>
Are you okay?<End>
Yeah...<End>
Yesterday I went to the high school
library with Emma.<End>
Yesterday?<End>
Emma was reading this difficult-looking
book.<End>
Do you remember the title of the book?<End>
No. But it was on top of the high
bookshelf. I think it was a book on
philosophy.<End>
I saw her fetch it down, so I remember
it pretty well.<End>
A philosophy book?<End>
I feel like there's some meaning behind
Emma's disappearance and what
she did yesterday.<End>
It's like she's guiding us somehow...<End>
...<End>
It's like I'm having
the strangest dream...<End>
Yeah...<End>
Hello, sir.<End>
Hi Matthew.<End>
Winona, come right on into the store
after you're done.<End>
Okay, Dad.<End>
Well, thanks again, Matthew.<End>

Let's hurry!<End>
Hurry up!
Grouver Hospital!<End>
You can come in.
We're done here.<End>
Looks like we got chased out.<End>
No choice but to come back tomorrow.
You keep the locker key, Matthew.<End>
See you tomorrow, then.
Don't forget the locker key!<End>
Welcome!
Full service, yes?<End>
All done!
Thank you!<End>
Where...
Where is Emma?!<End>
Matthew?!
Come on in.<End>
Huh?! You...<End>
What?<End>
Shit...<End>
What?!
What do you want with me?<End>
Nothing.<End>
Then get lost!
Don't follow me!<End>
Follow the Lookout<End>
Follow your target without being spotted.
Use the trees and walls as cover!<End>
Hey, you! Quit following me!<End>
Hmm, now what was the code again...?
○, △, and...
Huh...? Oh right, just double each digit!<End>
Enter the four digit code.<End>
It opened!<End>
No good! It won't open!<End>
Hmm, I don't know...
Something about doubling each digit?
He pressed ○, ?,△ ,?<New>
So I just repeat each digit in place of ?.
Then I can get in.
So, the first three digits, are...<New>
○○△, or ○△△...?<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
Winona's here too...
Come on in.<End>
Matthew...
<End>
...<End>
Come in...<End>
Hey! You're the one who was with Mel
at the farm workers' lodgings!<End>
You're the one who followed me!<End>
You know where Mel is, don't you!<End>
Shut up! I still owe you one for what
you did!<End>
Got a moment?<End>
?!
What the hell do you want?
I ain't got nothing to talk to you about!<End>
?! ...You...<End>
Shit!<End>
Hey! Where is Mel?!<End>
I don't know... He just asked me to give
a message to Lorraine, that's all. <End>
Message? What message?!<End>
...<End>
Fine. I guess I'll just have to bring you
to Morgan.<End>
"I'm waiting at the room at the
Lakeside..."<End>
The lakeside? Is that all the message
said?<End>
Yeah. Ask Lorraine if you wanna know
more.<End>
Hmm, there?<End>
Oh, he ran away.<End>
Hmm? It's open...<End>
Shit! Get off me!<End>
You! You're that stalker from the bar!<End>
Who are you? What the hell were you
doing coming out of Isabella's
apartment?!<End>
Do you know where Isabella's gone?!<End>
Shut up! I'm not telling you!<End>
What did you say?!<End>
Ugh... C-Can't breathe...<End>
You know something, don't you?!<End>
I'm looking for her myself!<End>
*Gasp*<End>
She's not been on stage recently.
I'm the one who wants to know where
she is most of all!<End>
You're a stalker, aren't you? You must
have some idea what kind of
places she goes to?<End>
Don't call me a stalker!<End>
Whatever! I'm sure Isabella doesn't just
go back and forth between the
bar and the apartment building. <End>
...I've seen her coming out of the
junkyard once before.<End>
The junkyard? The one on the west side?<End>
Yeah. I don't know what business she
could have had in a place like that, but...
That's enough, right? I'm going home!<End>
The junkyard...<End>
Huh? What's this?<End>
It's the police badge Morgan gave to me.
Show it to him and he'll
tell you to let me in.<End>
Listen here, you're not a deputy.
There's no way I can just let you in. <End>
Please.<End>
No can do!<End>
What seems to be the problem?<End>
Huh? Haha! This kid wants to get inside,
and he's being a pain in my ass.<End>
...<End>
He's got a badge, doesn't he?
There's no problem.<End>
What he said.<End>
Well, if YOU say it's okay, Hudson, then,
fine. Go on in.<End>
Thanks.<End>
...<End>
Morgan!<End>
Check out the warehouse. I'll head over
to Grouver hospital.<End>
Yes, sir.<End>
Sigh...<End>
Did Dennis really kill himself?<End>
Yeah. He was still holding the gun when
we found him. And there was a
suicide note. <End>
What did it say?<End>
He admitted dealing Epoch. He must have
gotten scared after we found
the stash at the junkyard.<End>
What about Emma?!<End>
It didn't say. We'll check all the places
in town Dennis is associated with
for her.<End>
So Dennis was behind everything.<End>
Probably. If Isabella pulls through,
she might be able to confirm.<End>
I'm going to the hospital. Can you come
to the station later? There's a
lot I want to discuss with you.<End>
Okay.<End>
Is the main hall off limits?<End>
Let's go to the staff room.<End>
It won't open...
<End>
It says:
"Main Hall Off Limits"<End>
Let's go to the school!<End>
Matthew, you came to look at the lake,
too? Can you try to cheer Winona up
a bit?<End>
Winona is so put-together, but she
suffers inside.
As her father, I worry for her...<End>

I'm so worried about her...<End>
That guy and his kid...
They've got a serious attitude problem.<End>
I feel bad for those farm workers.
Have you seen them protesting?<End>
Astin Farm is so uncooperative.<End>
Feel bad for the farm workers.
Not sure what Dennis is doing.<End>
That guy and his kid...

Have you seen them protesting?<End>
Astin Farm is so uncooperative...<End>
Dennis and Mel are too similar.
Both quick to anger, and mean as hell.<End>
You can't drink here.
Why don't you just go home?<End>
Mel is such an idiot.
<End>
That old man and his kid are creepy.
Honestly...<End>
You can't drink here.
Don't think I'll just turn a blind eye.<End>
I'm busy.
Quit talkin' to me.
Everyone needs to get off my back...<End>
What business do you have here?
Hmm...
Nothing I care about.<End>
I'm busy.
Quit talkin' to me.
Everyone needs to get off my back...<End>
Shut up!
Quit tryin' a talk to me.
Get lost!<End>
What business do you have here?
Hmm...
Nothing I care about.<End>
Shut up!
Quit tryin' a talk to me.
Get lost!<End>
Shit...
Why are you...
Shit!
<End>
What?!
Just leave me alone!<End>
Matthew, what do you want?<End>
What are you doing here?
Not that I care, really...<End>
You came to my house?
What for?<End>
None of your business where I go.
Quit hounding me!<End>
What did you come here for?
I have nothing to say to you.<End>
What are you doing here?
What?!<End>
Don't you dare follow me!
Jerk...
<End>
Shut up!
I hate everyone today.<End>
Just give it up, already!<End>
What are you doing here?
Come to mock me?<End>
Things weren't supposed to go this way.<End>
You got a problem with me going back to my own home?<End>
You're so annoying.
What do you want?<End>
This house feels weird.
Feels weird without Dad somehow...<End>
God...
I can't believe Dad would kill himself...<End>
What do you want with me?
Don't follow me!<End>
Everywhere I go, you show up!<End>
Don't come to my house!<End>
Still trying to get in my way?<End>
You...
Everywhere I go, there you are!<End>
Don't you follow me!
I'm so sick of seeing your face!<End>
I'm just going home, do you mind?!
Quit following me like you're a pig
on patrol.<End>
Hi, Matthew.
Do you think... you'll find Emma?<End>
I'm worried for Sarah...<End>
Looking out across the water relaxes
me. So much hidden beneath the
surface... just like Emma.<End>
I'm not planning to stay here.
I'm just out walking, thinking about
Emma.<End>
Winona should be heading home around
now. I'm off to the church, but would you
mind giving her a lift?<End>
I'm keeping an eye on the town... it's my
duty as mayor. Actually I'm just 
wandering around, hoping I'll find Emma.<End>
Matthew, have you checked out the
noticeboards?<End>
I'm keeping an eye on the town... it's my
duty as mayor. Actually I'm just
wandering around, hoping I'll find Emma.<End>
Matthew, I didn't know Emma...
not at all...
I feel like having a drink...<End>
You'd better head home.
Dangerous out at night.<End>
Matthew...
Sarah's cheered up a lot.<End>
I wonder what Emma is doing right now...
Emma...
Is she... all right?<End>
Matthew, out for a walk?
Nothing better than a bracing walk.
I wish I could get Sarah out of the house.<End>
Matthew...
I want to thank you for your concern.<End>
Emma...
I wonder how the investigation is doing?<End>
Matthew, out for a walk?
Nothing better than a bracing walk.
I wish I could get Sarah out of the house.<End>
I wonder what Emma is doing right now...
Emma...
Is she... all right?<End>
Maybe she was crying out for help, but I
missed the signs...
Sigh...<End>
Hey, Matthew... I feel like there's
something in the forest. You'd better
stay away. Better safe than sorry.<End>
Today, some of the elders are going to
search the forest from 4.
I hope there's some clues about Emma.<End>
There WAS a bear in the forest.
We're going to hunt it tomorrow morning
from 7.<New>
Nozz is desperate to help out.<End>
Tomorrow morning, 7am. We're going to
get that bear that mauled Kathy.
You stay away, all right? It'll be<New>
dangerous in the forest.<End>
Matthew, thank you for your concern.
I should take better care of my health
from now on.<End>
You're still in high school.
You can't just run all over town at night.
Go home like a good boy.<End>
The forest is on my mind.
Me and the forest, we go way back.
I have to watch over it.<End>
Listen, Matthew.
Go directly to Morgan or myself if
anything happens.<End>
Matthew, stay out of trouble.
If you find anything, inform Morgan.
He'll take care of it.<End>
You're still in high school.
You can't just run all over town at night.
Go home like a good boy.<End>
Listen, Matthew.
Go directly to Morgan or myself if
anything happens.<End>
Matthew, stay out of trouble.
If you find anything, inform Morgan.
He'll take care of it.<End>
You shouldn't be out at this hour.

Run on home now.<End>

Go home like a good boy.<End>
Matthew, I don't expect to see a boy like
you in a place like this.
Go home like a good boy.<End>
It is my mission to save those who
frequent sinful establishments like
this one.<End>
It grieves me to see you going in and out
of a place like this.
Repent, Matthew.<End>
What?
Spit it out, I'm busy.<End>
All they do is bitch and moan.
A disgraceful lack of respect towards
their employer...<End>
What do you expect to get out of
loitering here?
You're in my way!<End>
What do you want?
Is there something on my face?<End>
Huh? What? I'm observing.
I doubt I'm interested in anything you
have to say.<End>
Tch...
It's just one thing after another with
you people...<End>
Shit!
I'm busy, get lost!<End>
Quit loitering here!
Get out of the way!
Go on, get out of here!<End>
What?
Spit it out, I'm busy.<End>
Huh? What? I'm observing.
I doubt I'm interested in anything you
have to say.<End>
What?
Spit it out, I'm busy.<End>
What?
Come to drool over my mansion?<End>
What? I'm busy.
I doubt I'm interested in anything you
have to say.<End>
What?
If you don't want anything, get lost!<End>
I'm not gonna give you any food, so stop sniffing around!
Got it? Now get lost!<End>
What?
Come to drool over my mansion?<End>
Man...
I wish it was always like this.<End>
What are you doing, Matthew?
Why don't you rest at home today?<End>
I've got nothing to say to you.<End>
Get lost!
I'm busy.<End>
What do you want?
Get off my land!<End>
...
What do you want?<End>
Hey!
Kids should keep out!
Now go home!<End>
What?
Get off my land!<End>
I've got nothing to say to you.<End>
What?
Come to drool over my mansion?<End>
President! You have to rebuild!
...Sigh... He's not listening to us at all!
He's just giving us the runaround!<End>
We just want you to fix our living
situation!
President! We demand refurbishments!<End>
We're not asking for much!
We just want to live in decent
accommodation!<End>
President! We demand refurbishments!
...Sigh... Still no progress.
Has God forsaken us?<End>
Is there any point saying any more?
It is all so pointless...
What should we do?!<End>
Look at what we've been reduced to!
He won't meet with us today, either...<End>
Maybe we're asking for too much?
What should we do now?<End>
I won't give up until the President hears
me!
I'll keep fighting!<End>
It's not like we're asking for him to build
us a palace!
Why won't he listen to us?<End>
When will this miserable lifestyle end?!
I won't give up...<End>
I'm so tired...
I'll console myself with food.<End>
So tired of walking...
I'm pooped.<End>
Sigh...
I've tired myself out.
Even talking is too much effort.<End>
I just hate everything right now...
...Should I just give up?<End>
The President just says whatever to
placate us! But he's making no moves
towards refurbishments!<End>
Our protest shall continue!
This is our lives, after all!<End>
I can't stand living like this much longer.
I feel like throwing rocks or something.<End>
I don't wanna go back to that crappy
hut...
But we have nowhere else to live.<End>
Why won't he even consider it?

This sucks.<End>
Hi, Matthew.
Come on in.<End>
We're cracking down on suspicious
persons.<End>
It's late, kid.
Anything could happen to ya.
Run along home.<End>
The bar's open from 8.
How desperate for a drink are you, kid?<End>
Hmm...
This is my favourite time of day. Before
opening hours, just chilling out.<End>
You're not following me, are you?
What are you, some sort of stalker?<End>
Ahhhh.
You gotta kick back and relax
sometimes, you know?<End>
What's the good word, son?
Heh heh...<End>
You're out late. Goofing around.
Just do what you feel like, don't ya?<End>
How's it hanging, son?
Heh heh...<End>
Hmm...
This is my favourite time of day.
Before opening hours, just chilling out.<End>
Got too much time on your hands, son?
Come by my establishment tonight.<End>
You're out late. Goofing around.
Just do what you feel like, don't ya?<End>

What are you, some sort of stalker?<End>
Ahhhh.
You gotta kick back and relax
sometimes, you know?<End>
Got too much time on your hands, son?
Come by my establishment tonight.<End>
Leave me alone.
I want to be by myself...<End>
Mel...
So stubborn, yet hates to be alone.<End>
I need to think about some stuff by
myself.
Yeah, even I need alone time sometimes.<End>
Leave me alone, please...
Sigh...<End>
I was driving the other day and I ran out
of gas! What a shocker. You ever run out
of gas? It's no fun, I can tell ya.<End>
Ahhh.
Just chilling.
I cherish these moments.<End>
Hehe, well, hello!
I'm out shopping today!<End>
Hehe, well, hello! I'm all done shopping!
Now I'm going to my friend's house in
Barren Hill.<End>
Hehe, good evening!
I shopped WAY too much today!
Must dash home!<End>
It's Christmas.
Better get home before dinner, or
there'll be trouble.<End>
My kids told me not to go out in the snow
or I'll slip and break my fool neck.
Just who do they think they're talkin' to?<End>
It's cold.
No matter how cold it gets,
I'll keep walkin'.<End>
The town church is on top of that big hill.
It's hard on us old folks.
But I wanna see the father.<End>
Oh my, hello there.
Did you hear?
There's a bear in the forest.<End>
Ho ho!
You're up early for one so young!<End>
The main school building's been placed
off-limits. I forgot something in my
locker but I can't get in.<New>
Guess they don't trust me...<End>
I wanna get into the main school building
but Teach says no can do.
I'm gonna bring my friend Mike.<New>
Everyone trusts him.<End>
My hobby is secretly following people.
I pick my target, then I follow 'em
around town.<New>
Observing someone's daily routine...
it's kinda fun.<End>
Postal service!<End>
Hold on...<End>
Yikes...<End>
Postal service!<End>
Let's get outta here!<End>
Hewwo! Gwandpappy's takin' me to the
park today!<End>
Gwandpappy was supposed ta be takin'
me to the park.
...How boooooring!<End>
*Huff* *Puff*
It's Christmas!
Merry Chris...ack! *Cough* *Choke*<End>
*Huff* *Puff*
So cold in the mornings...
And with this cold...ack! *Cough* *Choke*<End>
*Huff* *Puff*
Gotta get home before dark...ack!
*Cough* *Choke*<End>
Hello.
I'm doing some shopping today.
Yes, I know it's Christmas.<End>
Good morning.
I moved into an apartment nearby, but I
don't know the town yet.<End>
Hello.
I just moved in, so I have to shop for
supplies every day.<End>
Hello.
The diner is way too crowded.<End>
Shopping, shopping...<End>
My car sucks.
It's always breaking down.
And running out of gas.<End>
Hmm...
Breeze feels warm today.
I wonder why?<End>
Walking's got me a little tired out.
Guess I'm getting old. I thought I could
stay young by living in the sticks...<End>
Don't you scratch my new car.
I've seen you drive.
You're like a madman.<End>
People often say I work too much, but
I love my job. I'm always late going home.<End>
I ran out of gas once and got stranded.
Haha, it was so embarrassing.<End>
Shit...
They got away!<End>
Hello! My hobby is finding out what time
places open and close! The diner opens
at 7am and closes at 8pm.<New>
The search continues!<End>
I'm gonna tell you when the hospital's
opening hours are. Ready?
From 8 in the morning until 10 at night!<New>
But you can only visit patients until 8
at night!
My hobby is super cool!<End>
Hey, you know what my hobby is?
Finding out what time places open
and close!<New>
The sheriff's department is open from
7 am until 10pm!<End>
Hey, you know Bar Wolves' opening
hours? From 8pm until 1 in the morning!
Don't you think it's amazing<New>
a kid like me found all this out?<End>
Good morning!
I'm checking opening hours today!
The high school is open from 7am to 6pm.<End>
My hobby is finding out what time places
open and close! I just added a new one
to my collection!<New>
The church is open from 7am to 8pm!<End>
My hobby is finding out what time places
open and close! Captain Nozz's General
Store is open from 7am to 7pm!<New>
I can't promise it's like that every day
though!
It depends on how the owner's feeling!<End>

My hobby is memorising phone numbers.<New>
It's like a puzzle with the Playstation
buttons!
Gasoline Stand△○○△<End>
Hey do you know "The Ruins"?
I love going there to look around.
But last time I ran into this creepy<New>
old guy.
I barely escaped with my life!<End>
It's best to memorise phone numbers.
But someone forgetful like you needs a
notebook to jot them down.<New>
I don't need a notebook, though!
I never forget a number once I've
called it!<End>
Hey, you know how your notebook doesn't
automatically add new numbers?
You gotta call the number first,<New>
and if someone picks up, it'll get added
to your notebook!
It's not enough to just see the number.<End>
It's dark. Past bedtime for kids.<End>
Oh no! I forgot my notebook at home!
I need it for my phone numbers!
I think I left it in my drawer.<New>
Guess I'd better go home and get it.<End>
Nothing much to do at night.<End>
Guess I'll head home.<End>
The other day, I bashed my car into a
wall. My car got super stuck, so I just
called the Auto Garage.<New>
You and I drive old cars, so we have to
deal with a lot of maintenance.<End>
I was at the forest the other day, and I
had to head to the church for something
urgently. Well it took me 40 minutes<New>
at top speed!
My car only does 50mph, tops. Maybe I
should have picked a different route?<End>
Did you get a flyer for the Auto Garage,
too? My car's an old one too, so
sometimes it breaks down.<New>
The Auto Garage always helps me out.<End>
Good morning.
Huh? I look excited?
Well, duh! I'm on my way to a date!<End>
Hmm...
He's taking his time...<End>
Hmm... he's taking forever...
Okay, I'm starting to get annoyed.<End>
I run like this every morning.<End>
Spring's still so far off!<End>
Not too many people out and about
at this hour.<End>
I have to hurry back to the hospital.<End>
...<End>
...Why are you talking to me?<End>
Whaaat?<End>
You can't go into the main school building.
The library's open, though.<End>
