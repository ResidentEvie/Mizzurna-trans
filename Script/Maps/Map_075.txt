No one's picking up...
I'll call back later.<End>
Yeah, no one's gonna be there at this
time of night.<End>
This is the high school staff room.<End>
Is Miss Holden there?<End>
None of the teachers are here now.
Could you call back? I'm just the night
watchman.<End>
All right.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew?
I know you're worried about Emma,
but don't do anything dangerous.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew?
If you're troubled, you can talk to me.<End>
I'm still at the staff room, if you want
to come by.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
This is Matthew Williams.
Is that Miss Holden?<End>
Matthew? Why are you calling the
school?<End>
I want to check something, about Emma
and Kathy...<End>
You do...?<End>
I'd like to go into the main school building.<End>
Matthew...<End>
I understand how you feel, but all we
can do is wait while the police find Emma.<End>
Leave the investigation to Morgan.<End>
I know, but...<End>
Anyway, you can't go into the main
building.
It's been placed off-limits.<End>
But you can come and talk to me, in the
staff room. Okay?<End>
Okay.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew? Oh, good timing. Do you know
where Winona is?<End>
Is something up with Winona?<End>
I just went to the sheriff's department,
to ask about Emma's movements
yesterday.<End>
Apparently, she went to the library with
Winona.<End>
So I thought Winona might know
something about how Emma was
yesterday.<End>
I see.
I'll ask her about that if I see her.<End>
Thanks.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew? What's up?<End>
Um, how long is the library open for?<End>
I'll be heading home in a while,
but the building's open until 6.<End>
You're leaving already?
It's still early, isn't it?<End>
Well, it IS winter vacation.
But I still have lots of preparations to do.<End>
Bye.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Um, is Miss Holden there?<End>
Liz? Liz left already.
She's probably at the church.<End>
The... church?<End>
Yes, she goes to church often.<End>
I see...
Thanks.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, good morning.<End>
Today's Kathy's funeral, isn't it?<End>
Why don't you attend? I think it's from
9:30.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew... I realised at Kathy's
funeral... she really didn't have any
real friends...<End>
I heard she wasn't good with other
people, but none of her classmates
came...<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, don't push yourself too hard.
Me? I'm still at school.
I have a lot of work to do.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, I'm still at school, so stop by
if you need anything.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Miss Holden? She's not here yet.<End>
She should be here soon...<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Hello? Liz isn't here yet.<End>
She must have stopped by somewhere.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew?
How are you getting along with Mel?<End>
I always see you two fighting.<End>
That boy has a very bad home life.<End>
I wish Dennis would get his act together.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Hmm? Miss Holden?
She's gone home already.<End>
She said she was going to stop by the
church on her way to the hospital.<End>
Poor Liz, her only relative, hospitalized.<End>
Still, the old lady seems healthy enough.
Nothing to worry about, really.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Liz has gone already.
She's gone to visit her sick grandma
at the hospital.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, good morning.
Winona came to the library early
this morning.<End>
She was frantically looking something up.
I think she's desperate to help find
Emma, too.<End>
Matthew, you should help Winona.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew? Do you have business at the
school?<End>
I'm going to the hospital at around 3pm,
so come before then.<End>
It's Granny's birthday today, you know.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Miss Holden? She's gone for the day.<End>
She said it's her grandmother's birthday.<End>
I wonder if they're going to have a party
over at the hospital.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, you still don't know why
Emma's gone missing?<End>
I see...
I wonder if Sarah's all right...<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Huh? Liz left already. She said she was
going to the Rowlands'.<End>
That's Emma's house, right?<End>
I think Liz is quite concerned about
Emma's parents.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Liz has gone to Emma's house.
Liz lost both her parents at a young
age, you know...<End>
It's not the same situation, but I think Liz
understands how Emma's parents feel...
She always sounds so worried for them.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Good morning, Matthew...
It's the last day of the year...<End>
No one could have predicted all of this...
you just never know what's going to
happen...<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Hmm? Liz?
She's gone to Astin Farm.<End>
I think she's quite worried about Mel.<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
Matthew, I just went to Mel's house.<End>
I hope he's all right. He's not really a
bad kid.<End>
I just hope this experience doesn't scar
him emotionally...<End>
I doubt he's going to open up to you, Miss.<End>
Yes... it's probably none of my business
anyway...<End>
Mizzurna Falls High School.<End>
You want Liz?
She went to the general goods store.<End>
