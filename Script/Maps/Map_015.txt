Sarah.

Do you know what this disk is for?<End>
...A disk?<End>
I found it in Emma's locker.<End>
It's probably for the electric piano.<End>
Emma had one of those?<End>
I've seen her putting a disk in the piano
before.<End>
So this was a song Emma liked...<End>
It's a wonderful song...<End>
Emma...<End>
I wonder how this song used to make
her feel...<End>
Oh... my Emma...
My poor girl...<End>
Ohhh... oh no...<End>
Have you ever seen Emma use this
anywhere?<End>
I don't know... I wonder what it's for.<End>
I don't think it unlocks anything in the
house...<End>
I've seen it somewhere...<End>
I think I've got a similar one...<End>
Hmm, what kind of key would Emma and
I both have?<End>
Where have I seen it...<End>
Do you know anything about this note?<End>
Hmm, I wonder what it means?<End>
I don't really know...<End>
I see...<End>
I have no idea...<End>
I found this camera in Emma's locker.<End>
Oh, it's hers?<End>
I'd like to get the pictures developed.<End>
Yes... I'm desperate for any scrap
of information...<End>
I'll show them to you as soon as they're
ready.<End>
Okay.<End>
Please hurry!<End>
You're helping to find Emma?<End>
Yes. I promise, I'll find her.<End>
Thank you, Matthew.<End>
Oh... ohh...<End>
Don't cry. Emma will be okay.<End>
You'll find her... won't you?<End>
What if she was attacked by the bear...
just like Kathy?<End>
But if that was the case, we would have
found her by now.<End>
I think Emma got away safely. But maybe
she got hurt, and she's lying injured
somewhere, waiting for us to save her?<End>
I'm sure she's all right...<End>
Do you know what these are?<End>
No... I don't know?<End>
Some sort of pills. That's all I can tell.<End>
...I don't know?<End>
Th-Then...
Maybe Emma's in there?<End>
I don't think so.
I'm sure they checked on the 25th,
when they swept the forest.<End>
I see...<End>
I don't care where she might be...

I just want her to still be alive...<End>
Have you ever heard of this project?<End>
I don't know...<End>
What is it?<End>
I've never heard of it.<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
I don't need a cigarette, thank you.<End>
I see...<End>
No, thank you.<End>
This...<End>
What's this key for?<End>
I'm sorry, but I have no idea.<End>
What could it be for?<End>
That looks very old.<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
No, I don't.
Is it one of the ancient tribal relics?<End>
Is there something special about it?<End>
