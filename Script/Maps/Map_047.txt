Are you hurt?<End>
I'm all right. I'm more worried about
Cohen...<End>
Nozz took Cohen to the hospital.

His injuries don't seem serious.

No need to worry, really.<End>
So this is the beast that attacked Kathy...<End>
What's up?<End>
I just... I killed it...<End>
Couldn't be helped.

It's kill or be killed,

Animals kill each other in order to
survive. 
It's only we humans who kill
for stupid reasons.<End>
If Kathy died after being attacked by this
bear, maybe it attacked Emma too...

Isn't that what you mean by the rules<New>
of nature?<End>
...<End>
That's why we fight, too. 
In order to 
protect our own lives.<End>
Well, anyway...<End>
