Miss Holden, do you know what kind of
girl Kathy was?<End>
Kathy? Well, I've spoken to her, but...
I don't really know.<End>
She didn't seem like a very cheerful
girl.<End>
According to Father Barton, she was
introverted and didn't associate with
people much.<End>
That sounds like the case... maybe she
had something in common with Emma.<End>
Like what?<End>
Like nobody could ever tell what they
were thinking about.
 Perhaps this isn't
appropriate for me to say as a teacher...<End>
Isn't there anyone who knew Kathy well?<End>
I think her homeroom teacher would
know much more.<End>
Who's that?<End>
Holly. She's usually in the staff room
from 2pm.<End>
I see.<End>
What's this incident 40 years ago that

I see...<End>
There was a murder in this town
40 years ago.<End>
A murder?<End>
Grandma's little sister was killed.<End>
I see...
 why would Emma be interested
in something like that?<End>

The murderer killed his victim as part
of a ritual to worship the devil.

Emma wanted to know what kind of
person the murderer was.<End>
Who was the murderer?<End>
It seems he killed her in the forest...
