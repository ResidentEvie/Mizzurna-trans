No answer... he's not home?
Guess I'll call back later.<End>
Maybe he fell asleep.
Uncle's usually a night owl, though.<End>
Yes, who's calling at this hour?!<End>
Matthew? What's up?<End>
Don't call me for no reason!
Leave this until tomorrow!<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
I'm off to the store now.
If you want me, drop by.<End>
Yes, who's calling at this hour?!<End>
Matthew...<End>
You should get some rest, we're huntin'
a bear first thing tomorrow morning!<End>
Yes yes, Morgan says no, but just come
along anyway!<End>
We're meeting at the forest, 7am sharp!<End>
Yes, who's calling at this hour?!<End>
Matthew? Get to bed early, for
tomorrow.
I know, you like to be up and about late.<End>
But you'd better be there, forest
entrance, 7am tomorrow!<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Matthew?<End>
I don't know if someone new moved in,
or what...<End>
but the noise of footsteps clomping in the
corridor is driving me crazy!<End>
Who's being so loud?!<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Matthew, I'm sleep-deprived today.<End>
Noisy jerks clomping around the
apartment all night...<End>
Noise travels like crazy in this
old place...
I've had enough!<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Matthew...<End>
I went into the corridor to complain
about the noise...<End>
And Dennis was out there!
What's he doing there?!<End>
He'd better not be planning to bulldoze
the place!<End>
I know it's old, but I don't want to have
to move.<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Hmm? Oh, Matthew.<End>
I'm lacking sleep lately. Mornings are
tough.<End>
Yesterday, the guy with the beard,
arguing with the young punk...<End>
Can't they cut it out?!<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Matthew...<End>
My apartment's become a hellhole.<End>
What's this all these dodgy characters
hanging around?<End>
You be careful at night.<End>
Yes, this is Nozz.<End>
Matthew? You're up early.<End>
Last night, I finally got a decent night's
sleep!<End>
By the way, I haven't seen the pretty
lady recently.<End>
Maybe she was the source of all the
trouble lately.<End>
