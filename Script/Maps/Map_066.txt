The head doctor had some concerns
about Kathy's condition. I think he's going
to reveal something at the town meeting.<End>
It's due to start at the church soon.
Why don't you head up there?<End>
Hello, Grouver Hospital.<End>

Seems like the forest's being searched
later today.
Why don't you join?<End>
I don't know the exact time. I think
they're deciding that at the church
meeting.<End>

Doctor James has gone for the day.<End> 
He stops in at the bar every night...

It's a little hard to explain...<End>
If you head downtown, and go along the
lake shore, you'll reach the motel.
After the motel, turn right.<End>
