Hello! Who's calling?<End>
Uh, did you work on the dance party
committee?<End>
Dance party? The one this month? Yep.<End>
May I ask, was Kathy also a member
of the committee?<End>
Kathy Flannery?  Yes, she joined,  but
she wasn't very cooperative.<End>
How did she seem to you at the time?<End>
Are you her friend?<End>
Uh... sure...<End>
She joined, but she basically did nothing.
When I asked her why she bothered to
join, what do you think she said?<New>
"I'm rebelling against my father!"<End>
What do you mean?<End>
I don't know, either. But she said
something like a party celebrating the
full moon is like worshipping the devil...<New>
or something... what a weirdo. But she
also said there's a wall painting in the
basement of her house showing the devil<New>
worshipping the full moon.<End>
What the hell?<End>
Anyway, she was tough to figure out.
That's all I remember about her.<End>
Thanks.<End>
See ya.<End>
Yes! This is the hospital director's office.<End>
Huh? The... hospital director's office...?<End>
Yes, but Doctor Samuel is away from his
desk at the moment. May I ask who is
calling?<End>
Grouver Hospital?!<End>
Hello? Can you hear me?<End>
Oh, sorry...<End>
Is there something I can help you with?<End>
N-no... it's fine... I'll call back later.<End>
Why did I get through to the hospital
director's office at Grouver Hospital?<End>
Is there some connection between Kathy
and Samuel...?<End>
