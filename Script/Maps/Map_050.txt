?! Emma!<End>
Emma! Wake up!<End>
...<End>
It's all right! 
She's just unconscious.<End>
It seems we've prevented the
worst-case scenario.<End>
Who was trying to do the ritual?!<End>
?!<End>
Cohen!!!<End>
You weren't part of my plan.<End>
You... 
No...<End>
James?!<End>
Guhhhhh!<End>
?!<End>
You were... going to do the ritual...<End>
That's right, detective!

I'm the bad guy!<End>
I'm the one who synthesised this drug
for use in the ritual.<End>
No! Then...<End>
Yeah, I'm the one who sold it to Wolf.<End>
But why... 
you helped me so often...<End>
I did, didn't I?

See, I was actually also looking for
Emma, myself.<End>
What do you want with her?!<End>
That day, we all came here together to
perform the ritual.<End>
But then, in an unbelievable stroke of
bad luck, we were attacked by a bear.

I barely escaped with my life.<End>
