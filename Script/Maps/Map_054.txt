Matthew, now that I think about it,
I can't let you inside.<End>
Could you wait here?<End>
I understand.<End>
How is she doing...?<End>
Well, she's regained consciousness...
<Unk70>as you can see.<End>
...<End>
Her physical wounds aren't actually that
serious, but I'm concerned about the
after effects of her going into shock.<End>
It's like she's not really here...

Just keeps staring vacantly at the same
spot.<End>
To put it simply, her heart is beating but
her mind isn't working.<End>
Can she hear us?<End>
Probably not. 
It's hard to call this living.<End>
She is alive, though, isn't she?<End>
She is. 
In the literal sense of the word.
But to spend the rest of her days like
this...<New>
How pitiful!<End>
Doctor! Please don't say such things!<End>
...<End>
Father Barton...<End>
It seems she's regained consciousness.<End>
But, it doesn't seem like she's able to
speak.<End>
I see...<End>
...<End>
Matthew? 
Wait just a bit longer, please.<End>
It's me, Barton.
Would you permit me to pray?<End>
Come in!<End>
She's regained consciousness?<End>
You can pray, but she can't hear you.<End>
We do not pray to be heard.<End>
Doctor! Kathy is...<End>

Doctor...<End>
What the hell...<End>
What on earth happened?!<End>
She's dead...<End>
Huh?!<End>
I can't believe this has happened...<End>
Matthew...

...I'm going back to the department...<End>
What the hell 
is happening today?!<End>
Father Barton (56)<End>
Priest at the church in town.<Unk70>
Many of the townspeople trust him
completely.<End>
He adopted Kathy from an orphanage
and raised her as his own daughter.
He is her only family.<End>
