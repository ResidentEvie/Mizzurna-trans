Wonder what this disk is for...<End>
Perhaps it's meant to be used with a
computer.<End>
But I don't think I ever saw Emma near
a computer...<End>
Yeah...<End>
Maybe it's not a computer disk, then...<End>
Isabella? The lady who sings at the bar?
So, this is her song...<End>
Did she... give this to you?<End>
Yeah.<End>
Hmm...
You seem pretty friendly with her...<End>
No, not really...<End>
You've got a casette player in your
 room, right?<End>
You can listen to this song any time
you want.
That's really nice.<End>
Maybe, if you go and listen to it...<End>
You might come to some sort of
breakthrough about Emma...<End>
What's this, Matthew?<End>
I found it in Mel's room.
Some stuff happened, and I ended up
bringing it with me.<End>
"9pm, Motel..."
I suppose Mel got a room at the motel
for some reason?<End>
I guess. But I'm not sure this is a clue
to Emma's disappearance.<End>
Still, I'm curious about what he gets
up to...<End>
He's definitely been weird since Emma
went missing.<End>
Yeah...<End>
I hope it's a clue.<End>
Matthew? This camera...<End>
You haven't gone to get the pictures
developed yet?<End>
We should hurry and do it soon...<End>
Yeah, I agree.<End>
Please hurry, Matthew.<End>
I want to see the photographs.<End>
Look, Morgan gave me this sweet badge.<End>
Wow! Good for you!<End>
Now you can investigate Emma's
disappearance officially!<End>
Yeah, this might give me some extra
leverage to poke around.<End>
We can do it! Let's find our friend!<End>
Let's do everything we can!<End>
This ring was in Emma's house.<End>
Is it Emma's?<End>
I don't know...
There's a letter I on it.<End>
Hmm, a letter I...
Who could that be?<End>
We don't know anyone whose name
begins with I...<End>
Hmm, did Emma have any friends whose
names began with that letter...?<End>
Emma was with Kathy that day...<End>
But...<End>
Why the two of them?
And what did they go to the forest for...?<End>
What did they go there to do...?<End>
Do you think this has something to do
with Mel, and... the others?<End>
I'm not sure it's going to be much of a
clue.<End>
But, it's probably a good idea to ask
Doctor Samuel to identify it anyway.<End>
I wonder what it is...<End>
This off limits area... does it have
something to do with Emma and Kathy...<End>
It might be a big hint.<End>
Couldn't you ask Morgan to let you go
in there?<End>
An off limits cave... pretty suspicious.<End>
Check out this envelope.<End>
Project... Mizzurna?<End>
It seems Cohen has something to do
with this.<End>
Hmm, that's curious...
Maybe something to do with Cohen's
old job?<End>
But what's it go to do with Mizzurna
Falls?<End>
Eww, Matthew...<End>
Since when have you been smoking?<End>
Oh no, these aren't for me.<End>
Guess it looks kind of funny for me to
have these.<End>
What's this?<End>
It's the key to Cohen's lodge.<End>
Oh...<End>
What's that?<End>
It seems to be a relic used in the ritual.<End>
It has a very mysterious aura...
But... it's also creepy...<End>
I bet the bad guy is going to need this
again...
When he shows up, I'll grab him.<End>
What?! No!
That's too dangerous!
Don't approach him!<End>
Please don't do anything dangerous,
Matthew...<End>
