No answer... guess he's not home.
I'll call back later.<End>
He must be asleep already.
I should call another time.<End>
Hello, James speaking.<End>
Oh, Matthew.
Found Emma yet?<End>
Haha, just a joke!
Let's talk tomorrow, it's late.<End>
Hello, James speaking.<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
I'm just about to head to the hospital.<End>
I'll be in my office all day. Stop by.<End>
Fill me in on anything new.<End>
Hello, James speaking.<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
Tomorrow's the bear hunt. If you're
going, you'd better get an early night.<End>
Who knows if Morgan will let you join in,
though.<End>
You're worried about Emma, aren't you?
Then, fight. Morgan'll cave.<End>
But... if you find that bear...<End>
No, never mind. Anyway, good luck
tomorrow.<End>
Yes.<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
You're up late.<End>
Huh? Oh yeah, I had some stuff to
investigate.<End>
It's too late for you to be calling.<End>
I'm sorry.<End>
If you want to talk, wait until the
morning.
I'm off to bed.<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.
Stuck on the case?<End>
You need to get inside Emma's mind.<End>
If you can't find a link between Emma
and Kathy, you won't get anywhere.<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
It's late. You're still working on Emma's
case?<End>
Kathy was mauled by a bear, yes.
But WHY did she die?<End>
Just what kind of girl was she, anyhow?<End>
I think only Father Barton truly knows...<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
What's up?<End>
Uh... nothing.<End>
You know, I'm waiting on a call.<End>
Can we do this tomorrow?<End>
Okay...<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
Hey! Who's that?!<End>
Nobody, you be quiet.<End>
Is someone there right now?<End>
Uh...<End>
Just a colleague.<End>
Why are you calling?<End>
Never mind... if you've got a guest, I'll...
call back later.<End>
Thanks.
Well, bye.<End>
Hello...<End>
Oh, Matthew.<End>
I believe Emma is still alive.<End>
And, I believe she's somewhere in town.<End>
I've got the day off work tomorrow.
I'll see what I can dig up.<End>
