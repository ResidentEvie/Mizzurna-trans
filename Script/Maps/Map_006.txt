Have you ever seen this before?<End>
No... I've never even touched one of
those.<End>
Sorry, but I don't know.<End>
Sorry...<End>
I'm pleased that Emma liked my song,
but... if she'd never heard it, then she
wouldn't have gotten mixed up with me...<End>
What do you mean? Mixed up with you?<End>
I got her involved in...<End>
...Forget it, it's nothing.<End>
I think it's a wonderful song, too.<End>
Thank you.
Eternal, to me, is proof that I'm alive.<End>
It's only when I'm singing this song that
I feel free...<End>
Isabella...<End>
This song came to me, like something
out of a dream...<New>
I think if someone else had the same
dream, they would know this song
as well as I do...<End>
Have you seen this key before?<End>
What, that small key there?<End>
If you can remember anything,
anything at all...<End>
I'm sorry...
I don't know.<End>
I've never used it.<End>
What's this?<End>
Nothing special...<End>
I don't think it's got anything to do with
me.<End>
I see.<End>
I don't think I can help with this.<End>
What?<End>
I hate photographs...<End>
Is that so?<End>
Don't take my picture, okay?<End>
Don't worry, I won't.<End>
I told you not to take my picture!<End>
You shouldn't get mixed up in the affairs
of adults... for your own safety.<End>
I'm not gonna quit, not until I've found
Emma.<End>
Please, just leave it to the police...<End>
For your own good.<End>
That ring...<End>
I found it at Emma's house.
Do you know something about it?<End>
...

I gave it to Emma.<End>
You gave it to her?<End>
You shouldn't go showing that ring to
people...<End>
Why... why not?<End>
No real reason...
Just my advice.<End>
Perhaps I should give it back to you?<End>
No! I don't want it!
That's why I gave it to Emma.<End>
I don't ever want to wear that ring
again!<End>

...<End>
Anyway... you should just hold onto it...<End>
If you don't want it, you can just toss it
in the trash.<End>
So they went to the forest together...<End>
Did you know the two of them were
mixed up with drugs?<End>
?!<End>
...No.<End>
I see.<End>
Matthew, I...<End>
I'm sorry. It's nothing.<End>
I'm sorry...
I can't tell you anything.<End>
?!<End>
What are you doing with pills?!<End>
These might have belonged to Emma
or Kathy.<End>
Do you know what they are?<End>
No, but I was thinking of asking Doctor
Samuel to identify them.<End>
What's wrong?<End>
I don't know...<End>
I don't know anything about that!<End>
I'd like you to tell me what you know
about the place in this photograph.<End>
I'm sorry...<End>
I don't really know this town that well.<End>
Sorry...<End>
I've never seen it...
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything
about that...<End>
Why don't you ask someone who knows
the town well?<End>
I guess you're right.<End>
Please don't keep asking me...<End>
What? Are you giving these to me?<End>
I think I'll pass.
I quit smoking.<End>
I see...<End>
Sorry...<End>
What's that?<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
No, no idea.<End>
Please stop asking me, I don't know.<End>
Oh my, an antique!
It looks like a native tribal artefact.<End>
Are you interested in stuff like this?<End>
I don't really know anything about it.
But it's fun to look at.<End>
Thanks, I don't need to see it again.<End>
