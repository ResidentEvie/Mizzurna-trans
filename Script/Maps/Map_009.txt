Doesn't Emma's house have something
like an electronic piano?<End>
Isabella, eh...
Oh yes, I know! The infamous bar singer.<End>
What do you think?<End>
Sorry, but I've still never heard her sing.<End>
But everyone says it's a great song.<End>
I'd like to hear it sometime.<End>
Oh my, what's that key for?<End>
I don't know. That's the problem.<End>
It's a little small.
Doesn't look like a house key.<End>
I've never seen it, sorry.<End>
Hmm, what's this?<End>
"9pm, motel..."
Oh my goodness Matthew, are you
inviting me to a motel?!<End>
No, that's not what I-<End>
I may be young and pretty, but I'm a
married woman, you know!
I'll accept your feelings, but that's all!<End>
That's enough now, okay?<End>
Oh, a disposable camera.<End>
It doesn't have a flash, does it?<End>
No, it doesn't.<End>
Then you can't use it in places with low
light. You really need a flash to take
good photos.<End>
What's that?<End>
Oh, it's your special badge!
I've heard all about that!<End>
I hope I can count on your assistance.<End>
Yes yes, I'll help in any way I can.<End>
You can use the meeting room any time
you like.<End>
Okay.<End>
You can read my special case board, too!<End>
That badge looks good on you!<End>
Hmm, a silver ring.<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
Hmm...
I think this letter I must be someone's
initial.<End>
So the owner's name begins with I...<End>
Have you shown that to the sheriff yet?<End>
No, not yet.<End>
I see.
This is quite a find.<End>
You're something else, Matthew.<End>
You're amazing.<End>
Do you know what these are?<End>
No... some kind of pills?<End>
I don't really take medicine, even when
I'm sick.<End>
I think it's best to just let the illness
run its course.<End>
That's the off-limits area in the forest.<End>
Off-limits?<End>
Yes, the government ordered us to seal
it off.<End>
Why do you have a photo like this?<End>
What's this, then?<End>
I don't know...<End>
It's got the town's name on it.<End>
Some sort of project having to do with
the town?<End>
I've never heard of anything like that.<End>
Oh dear, Matthew!
You're underage, aren't you?<End>
I'm not going to smoke these.<End>
Well, I hope not...<End>
Cigarettes are so bad for you.<End>
Oh my, what's that?<End>
Why do you have Cohen's lodge key?<End>
Uh, never mind.<End>
What's up? <End>
This necklace...
It was caught in the bear's claw, wasn't
it?<End>
Yeah, I feel like if I hang onto it, I'll be
able to find Emma.<End>
Like a lucky charm.
It certainly has an unusual aura...<End>
It could be evidence - be careful not to
lose it.<End>
