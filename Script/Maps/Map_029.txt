Doctor Samuel...
 do you have a moment?<End>
Who are you?<End>
Matthew Williams.

I came to Kathy's room earlier with
Morgan.<End>
Oh yeah.

You're the kid Morgan brought.<End>
I want to know what happened in her
room earlier.<End>
When Kathy kicked the bucket?<End>
Er... yes... all I know is that Kathy
seemed to be in a fugue state, and then
she screamed, and then she died...<End>
Well, to put it simply, the cause of
Kathy's death was shock.<End>
You know that she was attacked by
an animal?<End>
What I think is that Kathy experienced
a terrible trauma that night.<End>
Then, a flashback of that trauma was
caused by some catalyst, and she died
as a result of that.<End>
What kind of catalyst?<End>
That's the question.<End>
Maybe some snow suddenly fell off the
roof outside of the window...
maybe Morgan's face was scary,<New>
maybe it was a combination of
everything...<End>
The only people inside that room were
you, 
Morgan, Father Barton,
 and James.<End>
There was a nurse there, too. <End>
A nurse?<End>
The head nurse.

She works in the nurse centre.<End>
Are you finished now?
I'm a busy man, you know.<End>
Yes. Thank you.<End>
I want to ask you about the bruising
on Kathy's neck.<End>
Bruising?<End>
Yes, bruising like she'd been choked.<End>
What about it? 
Though that wasn't the
cause of death, you know.<End>
But...<End>
Oh, I get it. 
You're saying someone tried
to kill Kathy that night?<End>
Morgan doesn't seem to be taking that
hypothesis very seriously...<End>
Maybe in New York, but this is a small,
rural town. That kind of thing's
unthinkable here.<End>
If you ask me, someone definitely choked
Kathy that night, though.<End>
From the bruises, can you determine
what time the choking occurred?<End>
I think within 24 hours of the time she
was discovered. But I'm no expert.

I may be hot stuff, but even I can't say<New>
for sure.<End>
Someone definitely choked her, though.
And it had to be a man.<End>
Why?<End>
It's obvious from the size and shape
of the bruising.<End>
I thought you said you're not an expert.<End>
It's just intuition!
I put a lot of faith in my hunches.<End>
Sigh.<End>
Listen, Kathy was probably messing
about in the woods with a guy, lighting
campfires and so on.<New>

And then maybe the guy got a little bit
mean and tried to feel her up or
something.<End>
And then she was like no, and the guy
choked her a bit. And then by coincidence
she happened to get mauled by a bear<New>
soon after. 
The guy ran away, and Kathy
was left all alone.
What do you think? Sounds perfect, huh?<$0004><End>
I wonder about that? Kathy didn't seem
the kind of girl to play around at night.<End>
Hmm, well... you never can tell what
today's youth are thinking.<End>
You don't even know what kind of girl
Kathy was, do you?<End>
True, I don't know anything about Kathy.

What kind of girl was she, anyway? <End>
So it was that bear who attacked Kathy?<End>
Well, Kathy's wounds match the bear's
claws.<End>
Can you tell from the bear if it attacked
Emma?<End>
Huh? From the bear? How?<End>
Uh... I don't know...
 like, checking its
stomach contents or something.<End>
Are you suggesting we'll find Emma's
dead body in the bear's stomach?
Impossible.<End>
I guess you're right...<End>
The bear didn't attack Emma.
 If it had,
her dead body would have popped up by
now. 
Unless the bear was a criminal<New>
mastermind, that is.<End>
Where's the bear's body?<End>
We're done checking it. 
I gave what was
left to Nozz. <End>
I see.<End>
Hey, isn't that old coot kind of creepy?

He was smirking at the bear's dead
body.<End>
Er... Uncle just likes hunting and
survivalist stuff.<End>
Yeah, I wonder...<End>
I'm sure that's all it is...<End>
Sup.<End>
About those drugs...?

Here's not a great place to talk.<End>
In the mornings and afternoons I'm in
the director's office on the second floor.
Come see me there.<End>
