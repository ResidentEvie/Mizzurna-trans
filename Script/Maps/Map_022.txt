About Kathy... I...<End>
Thank you.<End>
It's very sad.<End>
I doted on her like she was my own
flesh and blood ever since I adopted
her 12 years ago.<End>
The first time I saw her, I swore...
to give her a happy life.<End>
Now she's dead, and Emma is missing.<End>
God works in mysterious ways. 
All I can
do right now is pray.<End>
What was she thinking when she went
into that forest...?<End>
Maybe I didn't really know her at all...<End>
When is Kathy's funeral going to be held?<Unk70><End>
At the cemetery at 9:30 am tomorrow.<End>
I'd like her to be laid to rest as soon as
possible.<End>
Were Kathy and Emma close?<End>
Who knows?
Kathy was introverted, and
didn't associate with many others.<End>
Emma was going to the church on the
24th.<End>
Around what time?<End>
I think around 10pm.<End>
There's nobody who comes to the
church at that time of night.<End>
Well I thought maybe she came to see
Kathy?<End>
I see...
 then maybe after that they went
to the forest together.<End>
Still, I can't quite believe it. 
Kathy knew
she was not allowed out after dark.<End>
She must have snuck out without my
knowledge.<End>
About the necklace the bear had.

Did you give that to Kathy?<End>
Hmm, the necklace...<End>
Isn't it a native tribal artefact?<End>
I found it in the church basement.

She took a shine to it, so I gave it to her.<End>
Looking back on it, that necklace brought
her nothing but bad luck.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
It was worn by that devil...<End>
Huh?<End>
Nothing... an old tale... 
still... she was
never without it... <End>
But someone took it from her?<End>
Yes, it was a while back.
 She said she
gave it to someone who needed it more
than her.<End>
But if the bear that attacked her had it,
I suppose she must have been wearing
it that night.<End>
Yeah.<End>
Matthew, did you hear about the motel?<End>
Yes.<End>
It's unbelievable...
That girl...
doing drugs...<End>
Really, though, isn't it too crazy?

Emma and Kathy, doing drugs?<End>
I know, but we can't live in denial.

She truly was a sinful child...
She was...<End>
Father Barton, do you remember the
incident that happened here 40 years
ago?<End>
What's this about, all of a sudden?<End>
I'm curious about something.

Just doing some research.<End>
The Cougar incident, huh.
 I remember.
You can't forget something like that,
no matter how hard you try.<End>
About this Cougar guy...<End>
Matthew.
 That boy... he was the devil.

I don't want to talk about him.<End>
...
<End>
Uh... Did Kathy...

Did Kathy know about that incident?<End>
...
<End>
Hmm, I wonder.
 If so, she certainly
never heard about it from me. <End>
