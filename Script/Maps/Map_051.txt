I never thought that Wolf of all people
would betray me. Look how I've suffered
due to that oversight.<End>
Wolf betrayed you...?

So, it was you who shot him on the roof?!<End>
He was an idiot. 
He held Emma prisoner,
and hid it from me.<End>
Why do the ritual...?<End>
Hey, hey. Don't misunderstand, now.

It's not like I forced Emma or Kathy into
anything.<End>
I was simply trying to save them, two
such weak girls who weren't strong
enough to face up to the harsh realities<New>
of life.

Emma in particular said she'd be
delighted to join in my plan.<End>
Of course, I was really only in it for the
eternal life.<End>
You fool! 
What's the point of something
like that?!<End>
Did you really think you'd actually be able
to get eternal life?!<End>
Hmm, who knows...
<End>
Then, why?!<End>
You just don't get it. 
It's human nature
to want to experience the unknown. <End>
You know Cougar ended up with nothing!<End>
Cougar's flesh may have died, but his
mission was passed down to me.<End>
"Eternity is truth!"<End>
Our entire lives are but a speck of dust,
compared to the full history of the
universe...<End>
We humans live our whole lives with a
curiosity that can never be satisfied...<End>
I want to know... 
everything, everything
to do with this world. 
Life is so short...<End>
So you were willing to risk both Emma
and Kathy's lives just for that?!<End>
The human body is a tool for
experiments, a mere vessel for the soul!
<End>
Who cares if they live or not?
 Neither of
them had any strong reasons for living.<End>
How can you say that...?<End>
Enough talking.

How about handing it over?<End>

Handing what over?<End>
The Prophet necklace. 
I was waiting for
you to show up and bring it to me.<End>
...<End>
You want to say something?<End>
I could destroy it...<End>
Don't be a fool! Hurry up and hand it over!<End>
You could shoot me, but it would still be
destroyed.<End>
...What are you gonna do?<End>
I'm taking Emma, and we're going home!<End>
...I guess you got me.<End>
Emma!<End>
Aaaaagh!<End>
Did you forget how sound my
marksmanship is already?

It was easy as pie for me to shoot you in<New>
just your right arm.<End>
Guhhh!<End>
Well, then, Mr. Detective...<End>
Matthew...<End>
?!<End>
Emma!<End>
Shit! 
The effects must have worn off!<End>
Get back here!<End>
Matthew...
<End>
Cohen!<End>
*gasp* *gasp*<End>
Are you all right?<End>
Take my gun!<End>
