Nobody's picking up.
Guess I'll call back later.<End>
Guess it's kinda late.
<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew?
I'm kinda busy, call back later.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, we're not open yet.
We open from 7, okay?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew?<End>
No, no one's here. Well, except the
customers.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? What's up?<End>
Lorraine?
Is there anyone in the diner right now?<End>
No one important. Haven't seen Winona
today. The customers are all talking
about Emma.<End>
News spreads fast. It's a small town
after all.<End>
I'll stop by later.<End>
Okay.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, hold on a sec.
Here's your coffee, hun!<End>
...You sound busy.<End>
Some of the Astin Farm workers are
here, and they are NOT happy.<End>
They're campaigning for their lodgings
to be rebuilt, right?<End>
I think they're off to the farm again.<End>
I'll call back.<End>
Thanks.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? Have you seen that dope Mel?<End>
What's up?<End>
It's nothing really, just...<End>
He said all this stuff, then he just took
off, and I have no idea where...<End>
Never mind.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? Have you heard? Some of the
townsfolk are going to sweep the forest.
I wonder if they'll find Emma.<End>
I have to work so I can't join.
Why don't you go?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? Have you heard?
<End>
They didn't find Emma, but they DID
find evidence of a bear.<End>
Everyone's gearing up for a bear hunt.<End>
Hmm? Hold on...<End>
Huh? The bear hunt's not open to all?<End>
Did you hear that? The bear hunt's
restricted to a few elders, and it's
gonna be first thing tomorrow morning.<End>
I bet your uncle's going, right?<End>
Yeah, Uncle's weirdly into all this.<End>
Just a moment!
Sorry Matthew, I gotta go.<End>
Hello.<End>
Matthew? We're closed for the day.
The diner closes at 8, you know.<End>
Oh, some of the customers were talking.
Kathy's funeral is going to be held at
9:30 am tomorrow morning.<End>
I wonder who's gonna show.
She didn't have any friends after all.<End>
It's... so sad.<End>
I'm heading home soon. Drop by the diner
tomorrow if you have time.<End>
Hello!<End>
Oh Matthew... I thought it might be Mel.<End>
He may be rough around the edges,
but he's a stickler for timekeeping.<End>
I was just about to head out, so can
we talk later?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? Good morning!<End>
Isn't the bear hunt taking place at the
forest around now?
I hope no one gets hurt...<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, isn't Kathy's funeral taking
place around now?<End>
I wonder who's gonna show up there.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, have you seen Mel?<End>
He's been on edge all day.
Like he's freaking out about something.<End>
What's he gotten himself into now?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, did you hear?
Somone broke into Emma's house!<End>
It's gotta be related to her
disappearance, right?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, have you seen Mel?<End>
He came by the diner just now...
He was all on edge and left without
listening to me...<End>
What's going on in that thick head of his?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew...
Uh, yeah, we're about to close.<End>
I have plans with Mel now.<End>
Tomorrow, I...
Actually, I might be off work tomorrow...<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew...
I wonder how Morgan's doing?<End>
I bet he's too busy for a proper meal
these days.<End>
If you see him...
Uh, never mind...<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew... we're totally rushed
right now.<End>
If you're gonna stop by, wait until
after 2.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew...
Yes, I'm fine now, after the robbery...<End>
Really...<End>
Sorry, a lot of customers just came in.
Rubberneckers.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew...
Thanks, I'm fine now.<End>
That dumbass...<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, I'm so bored right now.<End>
Come by for a bite.
I feel like chatting.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, if you're not busy, swing by.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, the Mayor's here right now.<End>
He's just staring into space.
Probably thinking about Emma.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew?
Winona hasn't stopped by today.<End>
She always seems so lonely when she
comes here by herself...<End>
I feel sad just looking at her.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew?<End>
I can't focus on work recently...<End>
Why don't you stop by for a bite to eat?
I'll treat you.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, it's the last day of the year...<End>
So much has happened just in the last
week...<End>
Dating a moron doesn't pay...<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
I bet Mel's rattling his bars at the
sheriff's department right now...<End>
What an idiot.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, do you know where Mel is?
He's probably goofing off somewhere.<End>
I hope he doesn't do anything else stupid.<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew? Listen to this.<End>
Mel's here, but he's not listening to a
word I'm saying.<End>
Why am I dating a guy like this anyway?<End>
Hello, Haines Diner.<End>
Matthew, the year's almost up...<End>
I guess we're not going to find Emma...<End>
Poor Mr. Mayor, ending the year like
this...<End>
