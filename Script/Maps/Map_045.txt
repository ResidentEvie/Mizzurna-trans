Matthew Williams!<End>
?!<End>
What are you gawping at?!<End>
The sudden low voice startled me.<End>
Young people these days have no guts.<End>
So what do you want?<End>
Got any cigarettes?<End>
I told you, I don't smoke.<End>
Yes, I've figured out that much for
myself.<End>
Then...<End>
I'm asking you if you brought ME
any cigarettes.<End>
...I haven't brought you any.<End>
Jeez, you're useless.<End>
Heavy smoking will lead to an early
death.<End>
You're annoying. 
I've lived a lot longer
than you have.<End>
I don't think I like this old lady...<End>
Hey, you?<End>
Just ignore her...<End>
HEY!<End>
...<End>
Matthew Williams!!!<End>
What?!<End>
It's my birthday on the 28th.<End>
Oh, that's nice. 
Happy birthday.<End>
My party starts from the evening, so
make sure you come to my room then.<End>
Thanks for the invitation, 
but I'm busy.<End>
You want to know about Emma, don't you?<End>
You mean your tales of the past?<End>
If you want to know about Emma, come
to my room on my birthday. 
But I don't
let just anybody in empty-handed.<End>
Fine, whatever.<End>

Yes?<End>
It's Matthew...<End>
Matthew?

You're not empty-handed, are you?<End>
No, I've got them. Don't worry.<End>
Excellent. Then, enter.<End>
Here. 
Happy birthday.<End>
So you went with cigarettes in the end?<End>
Grandma!<End>
It's all right. 
I did just bring cigarettes.<End>
Right, cigarettes are the price of entry.<End>
Oh for goodness' sake...<End>
Are you leaving already?<End>
I think I'll stop by one more time before
I go home. <End>
I see. Take care.<End>
Excuse me, Matthew.

I'm just going to the cemetery for a bit.<End>
What's up?<End>
It's the anniversary of her parents'
passing.<End>
I see... 
it was a car accident, wasn't it?<End>
To live is to overcome many personal
hardships.


I wanted to tell that to Emma, too.<End>
To Emma?<End>
That girl was interested in so many
strange things... like...
"what's gonna happen to me after I die?"<New>

And she was fascinated by things that
happened years and years ago...<End>
You mean the incident 40 years ago?<End>
You know about that?<End>
No... I...<End>
Has it really been 40 years...<End>
So, what happened, then? 40 years ago?<End>
...<End>
I don't mind if you don't want to talk
about it.<End>
Could you go home now? 
I'm a little tired.<End>
If you want me to leave, I will.<End>
Thanks for the cigarettes.<End>
She seems strange...<End>
Matthew, I don't know why Emma took an
interest in what happened 40 years ago.
But it's painful for me to talk about.<New>

Ask Liz if you want to know about it.<End>
Thank you. 
Get some good rest.<End>
