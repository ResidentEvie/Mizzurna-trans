I'd like to see the head doctor.

Where is he, please?<End>
The head doctor, okay.

Please wait a moment.<End>
Morgan, I've been waiting for you.
Did you buy me any cigarettes?<End>
Barbara, I didn't bring you your
wretched cigarettes.<End>
Well, that's not very friendly!
Life in this hospital is dull enough without
even being able to enjoy my cigarettes.<End>
What about that young man there,
does he have any?<End>
I'm afraid I'm a minor.<End>
Oh, really.<End>
What a shame, I had something
interesting to say, as well...<End>
You're not one of the people of this town,
are you?<End>
Yes, he is.
We're heading to Kathy's room, so save
your stories until later.<End>
Kathy... 
poor Kathy..
Oh, dear me...
Such a sad thing to happen...<End>
Excuse me, the head doctor is in Kathy's
room, so please go straight there.<End>
Perfect! Let's go, Matthew.<End>
Kathy's in Room 201.<End>
Morgan, next time you come buy me
some cigarettes, will you?<End>
What illness does that old lady have?<End>
Barbara? 
She's got Ouchy Ouchy Feet.<End>
Ouchy Ouchy Feet?<End>
She's faking it.<End>
Barbara Holden (66)<End>
She loves to smoke.
She often says strange things, which
makes others view her as an eccentric.<End>
