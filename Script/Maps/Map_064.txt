No one's picking up.
I'll call back a bit later.<End>
Guess everyone's asleep.
I'll call back later.<End>
Yes, what?<End>
Huh? No, I don't know where Mel is.
I'm busy. Don't call me about Mel.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Wolf?<End>
Um... is Mel there?<End>
Huh? You're one of Mel's dumb friends?<End>
I have no idea where the kid is.
He's not in the house, that's for sure.<End>
I see.<End>
Don't call here again.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm. Who's this?<End>
If you want the boss, he's gone to the
church. There's a big town meeting going
on up there.<End>
Okay.<End>
Stop calling me, you freaks!
You can live in the lodgings the way they
are, and like it!!!<End>
Huh? Oh... you're not one of them.<End>
What do you want?<End>
Mel? He's probably out on his bike, or at
the diner or something.<End>
Bye.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Oh, you want the boss?<End>
He's gone to the lodgings on the hill.
The workers were very noisy yesterday.<End>
I'm afraid I'm not sure when he'll return.<End>
All right...<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
You want to know where Mel is?<End>
He's probably at the bar like the lowlife
loser he is.<End>
Is that all? I'm hanging up.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Sorry, I can't talk right now...
I'll call you right back...<End>
...<End>
What's with the attitude?<End>
Just not now, all right?<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
You want to know if Master Mel is home?<End>
He's out somewhere on his bike, I guess.<End>
Up to no good, no doubt.
What a shame.<End>
You should stay away from him.<End>
Hello? Mel?<End>
Huh? You're not?<End>
I thought he was home, but he must still
be out on that motorbike...<End>
Phone's been ringing for ages.
So annoying.<End>
Who'd want to talk to HIM that badly?<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Who are you? A new worker?<End>
You want Mel?<End>
He's probably at the bar.<End>
He'd better not be involved with... well...
never mind.<End>
Tch.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm. Dennis speaking.<End>
Huh? Mel? I dunno.
Maybe he's at the lodgings.<End>
You know, he has one of the units
up there?<End>
Just helped himself. Little jerk.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Oh, the boss? He's out right now.
Master Mel is out, too.<End>
Where?<End>
Perhaps at the lodgings up on the hill.
He's renting one of the huts up there
from the boss.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm. Dennis speaking.<End>
Huh? Why am I not going to refurbish
the lodgings?<End>
Because none of your business!!!
That's why!<End>
What?<End>
Of course I've got money!
The thing about the lodgings...<End>
I don't have to tell you anything!<End>
Yes, Astin Farm. Dennis speaking.<End>
Mel? I have no idea where that idiot is.
He causes nothing but trouble...<End>
I never should have let him use one of
the huts...
Terrible idea, for me...<End>
...Forget I said that!
I'm hanging up!<End>
Yes!!! Hello!<End>
Huh? Mel?<End>
I'm going to go pick the idiot up now.<End>
What an embarrassment of a son.<End>
Now I have to go all the way down to the
sheriff's department!<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
Oh, you want the boss?
He's gone to the sheriff's department
to pick up Master Mel.<End>


It's unbelievable...
Young Master Mel... armed robbery...<End>
Yes, Astin Farm. Dennis speaking.<End>
Huh? You want to know where Mel is?<End>
How should I know!!!
Probably slinking around town in shame!<End>
What a moron I have for a son.<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
The boss is out.
He's probably gone to look at the
apartment building.<End>
It's gotten pretty old and run-down.<End>
What!!!!<End>
Huh?! Mel? I have no idea where Mel is!
Don't ask ME!<End>
It's just one thing after another these
days!<End>
STOP calling me!!!<End>
Yes!!! Hello!
I know, I know, stop calling.<End>
Hurry up and get-<End>
Huh? ...YOU!
<End>
Tch...
Hanging up now!<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
The boss is out.<End>
You want to know where?
Let's see...<End>
He has many properties in town. He's
probably doing the rounds of them all,
you know, checking on them.<End>
Hello!
<End>
Hey! How long are you going to keep
watch-<End>
...?! Who's this?!!!
Don't call this late!<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
I just saw the boss go into the
warehouse.<End>
It's closed for the season, so I can't
think why he'd go in there...<End>
Yes, Astin Farm.<End>
The boss?
I think he went to the apartment building.<End>
I wonder if he's thinking of rebuilding it.<End>
But... does anyone actually live there?<End>
Yes, Bonehead?<End>
?! ...You!!!<End>
What? You want to know where Mel is?<End>
I. DON'T. KNOWWWWW!<End>
I'm not gonna cover for that kid, not
anymore!<End>
I literally do not have time for his crap!<End>
