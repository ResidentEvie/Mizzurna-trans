Matthew...<End>
Are you okay?<End>
Yeah, don't worry about me.<End>
What's wrong?<End>
Matthew... do you... like Emma?<End>
Sure I like her.<End>
I think she liked you too.<End>
What's all this about?<End>
Nothing.<End>
My dad's put me under a curfew at
night.<End>
Can't be helped.<End>
Yeah, I get how he feels...

but it's not like I'm a kid.<End>
Yeah.<End>
Winona, do you have any idea what this
key is for?<End>
It's a locker key, isn't it?<End>
What locker?<End>
The lockers at school.<End>
...Oh, right! 
I knew I'd seen it somewhere
before.<End>
What's with the key, anyway?<End>
I found it in Emma's room and just
borrowed it. 
If we check her locker,
we might find some clues.<End>
Really! Then, I'll go with you!<End>
Oh, but it's getting late so let's do it
tomorrow.<End>
Let's hurry to the school.<End>
Okay!<End>
I just saw Mel.
He was in a terrible mood.<End>
Seems he didn't appreciate Morgan's
interrogation.<End>
Interrogation?<End>
Apparently, Mel was the last person
to see Emma on the 24th.<End>
He said she was on her way to the
church.<End>
The church?
Then, she must have met up with Kathy...<End>
Probably, yeah.<End>
They never hung out together, did they?<End>
We've known Emma a long time.
If she was close with Kathy, we'd know
about it.<End>
That's true...<End>
Did you see Mel?<End>
Nope.
Did you see Mel?<End>
Actually...<End>
Epoch...<End>
But I don't think Emma took any.<End>
But...<End>
We have to believe in her.<End>
Yes... you're right...

We have to believe in her...<End>
So Mel was the one who gave them both
the Epoch?<End>
It's the only explanation that makes
sense. 
Mel was scared Emma would
tell someone about the Epoch.<New>

That's why he's been so weird ever
since she went missing. <End>
I wonder if Mel was in the forest
as well on the night of the 24th?<End>
I wonder... but if he WAS there,
he wouldn't have told the police that
he saw Emma at 10pm that same night.<End>
That's true.<End>
What's up?

You don't seem very cheerful lately.<End>
No, I'm fine.
Just...
 whenever I think about what
happened in the forest that day...<End>
Yeah, about that...<End>
...So, Kathy and Emma did the ritual
that day?<End>
I don't know...

But Kathy was found in the same place
Cougar used for the ritual.<End>
Yeah... but just how do you perform
this ritual?<End>
Yeah... 
maybe I should check out
the forest one more time...<End>
