I'd like to have this camera's pictures
developed.<End>
Okay! 
We have a lot of different printing
options. Is Regular okay?<End>
That's fine.
 How long will it take?<End>
We're quite busy right now, but I can
have it done in an hour.<End>
We require payment up front.

Is that all right?<End>
How much is it?<End>
9 dollars and 50 cents.<End>
Pay
Forget it<End>
Thanks! 
Come back in an hour.<End>
Changed your mind?
Fine, but we're the only photo shop in
town, need I remind you.<End>
Welcome, Matthew.<End>
Are my photos done yet?<End>
No, not yet. Are you that desperate to
see them?<End>
Give it a while and come back later.<End>
Welcome!
Oh, hey Matthew.<End>
I heard about Emma.
<End>
But don't worry. I'm sure she's probably
fine.<End>
Uh-huh.<End>
Hmm? Did you want something?<End>
What's up?<End>
Er, I'll come back later.<End>
You know...
 I might not look busy but I
really am!<End>
Huh? Matthew, didn't you meet up with
Winona?<End>
Huh?<End>
She already came by to pick up the
photographs.<End>
What, Winona did?<End>
Yes... 
she said you'd asked her to...

oh no... should I not have handed them
over?<End>
No, it's fine if it was Winona.<End>
<End>
Sorry about that...<End>
?<End>
Whoah!<End>
Matthew! Are you hurt?<End>
I'm... I'm fine...<End>
That was a robber just now!
I'll chase after them!
You just lie there and rest a moment!<End>
