When I'm alone, I think strange things...
I've got to pull myself together...<End>

Sarah, are you all right?<End>
Thank you, I... have odd thoughts when
I'm alone...<End>
Is Steve at home?<End>
He went to the church. They're having a
meeting, about the forest search...<End>
I see...<End>
Sarah, I'm sure Emma is all right.<End>
Yes... thank you...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
I have this feeling like Emma's going to

happened...<End>
I just... miss her so much...

I understand.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, they... they didn't find Emma in
the forest.
I'm... not sure how I feel about that...<End>
I don't think what happened to Kathy has
anything to do with Emma...<End>
Yes... I'd like to believe that...<End>
Is Steve at home?<End>
He said he was going to stop by the
sheriff's department on the way home.<End>
I understand.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
Tomorrow they're going to hunt for the
bear from 7am, but... they're not looking
for Emma this time...<End>
I feel like Emma could still walk through
the front door tomorrow...<End>
Yes...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, it's been an eventful day.
I'm exhausted.
Sarah's resting in bed already.<End>
Could you... come and visit tomorrow?
It's... a bit strained between us right
now.<End>
I understand...
Good night.<End>
Good night.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, good morning, Matthew.<End>
Sarah's not recovered from the shock
yet...<End>
It's okay... she'll be better in time...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew?<End>
Steve's not here right now.<End>
He said he was going to see Morgan...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
Someone just broke into our house.
Things are a bit crazy here just now.<End>
Oh no, it's all right. I don't think the thief
took anything.<End>
But, I'm worried about Sarah...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...
Steve's at the sheriff's department...
because of the burglary...<End>
