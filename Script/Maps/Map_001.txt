What's that you've got there?<End>
It's a floppy disk.<End>
A disk? Must be for a computer, then.
You want to see what's on it?<End>
I don't have any computers in the
shop. If you want a computer, let's see...
how about the sheriff's department?<End>
That makes sense.<End>
Ask that nice girly at the sheriff's
department to help.<End>
I want to listen to this tape. Can you
lend me one of the stereos you've got?<End>
A stereo?
What's wrong with the cassette deck in
your room?<End>
If you want to listen to tapes, go use
that.<End>
Okay...<End>
Go use the tape deck in your room.
At a reasonable volume, mind you!<End>
What's up?<End>
Do you know what this key is for?<End>
Hmm...<End>
Judging by the size of it...
It's for a desk drawer, or a locker or
something, I'd say.<End>
A desk drawer, or a locker. Definitely.<End>
A locker, huh...<End>
Ask Winona.
If it looks familiar to you, it might look
familiar to her, too.<End>
Uncle, what do you think of this?<End>
Hmm? Show me.<End>
Huh? You've got plans to meet someone
at the motel?<End>
No... never mind...<End>
It says, 9pm, motel.
I didn't know you had it in you, Matthew!<End>
What are you doing, Matthew?<End>
You know I don't develop photos at the
shop.<End>
Where can I get them developed?<End>
Take it to the photo shop in Central
Square.<End>
Can't help, sorry.<End>
You, as a deputy, eh?<End>
Next bear hunt, you can shoot all you
like! Pow pow!<End>
I don't think that's going to happen...<End>
...It'll be fun.<End>
What's that ring? Very unusual.<End>
You've not seen one like this, have you?<End>
You want to sell it in the shop?<End>
No!<End>
I bet it'd fetch a pretty price.<End>
So they went to the forest together.<End>
I wonder if the bear chowed down on
Emma, too.<End>
Uncle!!!<End>
Poor girl...<End>
Uncle, about these pills...<End>
What!
How many times have I told you?!
Just say no to drugs!!!<End>
If you feel bad, deal with it organically!<End>
Don't go taking that trash!<End>
Uncle, tell me about the place in this
photo.<End>
Oh, that off-limits area.<End>
I don't really know much about it.<End>
I told you, I don't know.<End>
What's that you've got there?<End>
Project Mizzurna?
What's that, then?<End>
Don't you know anything about it?
Anything you can think of might help...<End>
Let's see... no.<End>
Don't need 'em anymore?<End>
No, I...<End>
I don't want 'em either.<End>
What?<End>
Hmm?
That's not my shop key.<End>
I know.<End>
What's this, then?<End>
I don't know.<End>
Now, THAT looks old.
Is that what was stuck on the bear?<End>
Yeah.
Do you know what it's for?<End>
Nope... but it looks like it'd be worth
money.
I could sell it as an antique...<End>
How about donating it to the store?<End>
