What's this?<End>
Found it in Emma's locker.<End>
Oh really, in Emma's locker...<End>
I can check it out.<End>
No, don't bother.<End>
Shit, why you gotta turn down a favour
when someone offers?<End>
I don't trust you.<End>
Huh, do what you want.<End>
Leave me alone!<End>
Isabella?<End>
You've heard her songs, right?<End>
Oh, I SEE. So that's your type, is it?<End>
That's not what I'm saying.<End>
Well, they say immature dudes always
go for the older ladies.<End>
I told you, it's not like that.<End>
Shit, just admit it, man.<End>
What?<End>
I found this in Emma's room.<End>
In... Emma's room?!<End>
What's wrong with you?<End>
N-Nothing...<End>
I don't know anything!<End>
I can't show this to Mel...<End>
So... you're using the motel?<End>
What?!<End>
I asked you, if you're using the motel.<End>
What would I use the motel for?!<End>
I've got my own place, why would I blow
money just to sleep at a motel?!<End>
None of your business, right?!<End>
Huh? What do you want?!<End>
It's just a camera.<End>
If you take my picture, I'll break
your face.<End>
I won't.<End>
Shit...<End>
Leave me alone!<End>
...You tryin' to show off?!<End>
No...<End>
Huh. You're such a little shit, Matthew.<End>
I ended up in a heap of trouble all thanks
to you!<End>
That's because you keep doing dumb
stuff.<End>
What?!<End>
You tryin' to pick a fight?!<End>
Huh?! You little shit!
Where did you get that ring?!<End>
Emma had it. You know something?<End>
Emma...<End>
Hey! What's with this ring?!<End>
I dunno...<End>
Huh?<End>
I said I don't know!
My mistake.<End>
I told you, I don't know!<End>
What? It's a Wolves flyer. So what?<End>
Kathy wrote on it.
She clearly had plans to meet with
Emma.<End>
Did you know that they knew each other?<End>
I dunno.<End>
At the bar, Kathy was always off talking
with some girl, and Emma was always
chatting to Wolf.<End>
Emma and Wolf?<End>
That creep took a liking to Emma.<End>
Is that so?<End>
Yeah, but even though she's missing,
he doesn't seem bothered at all.<End>
After slobbering all over Emma for all
that time. Bastard.<End>
Wolf's notorious for chasing skirt.
I doubt Emma would ever have been
interested in him.<End>
?!<End>
What are you implying?!<End>
Nothing, just wanted to ask if you knew
what these pills are.<End>
I don't know anything!
And where the hell did you get those?<End>
I found them... somewhere.<End>
Shit...<End>
I know you're hiding something,
something to do with these drugs.<End>
Those have got nothing to do with me!<End>
Huh? The hell's that?<End>
You've seen it before?<End>
I've never seen that place in my life.<End>
What's so important about it?<End>
What?!<End>
Are you saying I've got something to do
with that?<End>
Yeah, guess not.
After all, you've had your hands full.<End>
Sorry I even asked.<End>
Leave me alone!<End>
Huh, never saw you as a smoker.<End>
No, I don't smoke.<End>
Hmm...<End>
If you don't need them, I'll take 'em.<End>
What?!<End>
This...<End>
I don't know!<End>
That's enough!<End>
What's that for?
<End>
It's not mine.
I wouldn't have something so gross and
creepy.<End>
I see...<End>
Just leave it!
I already told you it's not mine!<End>
