all kinds of bad things have been
happening...<End>
I have to tackle this mountain of
paperwork.<End>
I'll be here for a while, so stop by
if you have anything to talk about.<End>

Why don't you stop by?<End>

something he wanted to check out.<End>
All right.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew, Cohen's here right now.
There's quite a serious discussion going
on, can you call back later?<End>

Department.<End>
Matthew? You want the sheriff?
Hold on...<End>
He's gone to see Mr. Astin.<End>
I don't like that man. Dennis.<End>
He always seems angry.
I bet he skips breakfast.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew?
The sheriff's here but he's a little busy
right now.<End>
You know he hates talking on the phone.
Why don't you stop by?<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew?<End>
You're working late.<End>
I'll work late until Emma is found safe.<End>
I hope you're at home.
I know you live by yourself, but don't use
that as an excuse to run wild.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
The sheriff? He's gone home.
Call back tomorrow.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Hmm? You want Sheriff Morgan?
He went home ages ago.<End>
I'm the only one still here at this time
of night.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
