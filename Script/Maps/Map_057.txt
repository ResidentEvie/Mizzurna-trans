Is it urgent?<End>
No, it's all right.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's

a bit tied up right now.<End>
The meeting at the church is due to start
soon. I won't be back until dark, can this
wait until later?<End>
I understand.<End>
Sorry about that.<End>

Matthew? The sheriff won't be back
until dark.<End>
I understand.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Hello, Matthew.<End>
The sheriff? I think he's at
Barrows Forest.
They're about to start the sweep.<End>
I see...<End>
Don't worry.
Emma will turn up.<End>
Thank you.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew? the Sheriff's not returned yet.<End>
The forest sweep should be finishing up
about now, so he should be back soon.<End>
He might have stopped by Cohen's
on his way back.<End>
Thanks.<End>
He should be back around 7.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew, the sheriff should be back
around 7.<End>

Give me a break, will you?<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew?
The sheriff's in the little boys' room.<End>
Er, I'll call back then.<End>
Sorry about that.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.
Matthew? Good evening.<End>
The sheriff's gone out.<End>
He said he had something to discuss
with you.<End>
But I shouldn't think he'll be returning
here any time soon.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew?
Why are you calling at this hour?<End>
I'm... worried about Emma.<End>
I understand, but you need to get your
sleep.<End>
Are you still at the office?<End>
Yeah, I'll be here a little while.<End>
All right.<End>
Go to bed.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
What's your business?<End>
Um, is Morgan there?<End>
The sheriff's gone home.
I'm on the night shift. It's just me here.<End>
I see.<End>
Call back tomorrow.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
YaAaAaAwWwnnn...

What's your business?<End>
When will the sheriff arrive?<End>
The sheriff? Uh...
He usually comes in around 7am.<End>
Thank you.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew, good morning.<End>
The sheriff is at the forest, I think.
He had his game face on, for the bear
hunt.<End>
I hope everyone comes back safe.<End>
Hello, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Oh, Matthew.
So we caught the bear, but we still have
no leads on Emma.<End>
We need to search for any link between
the two girls first. But there doesn't
seem to be anything...<End>
Yeah...<End>
Call me if you find anything.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Hello, Matthew.
The sheriff's investigating something
currently.<End>
I'd really rather not interrupt him
right now.<End>
I'll call back later.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew, Emma's house has been
broken into!<End>
We don't know what's been taken yet,
if anything, but you'd better hurry over
there!<End>
The sheriff should already be at the
Rowlands'!<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew, we still can't say anything for
sure regarding the burglary at the
Rowlands'.<End>
It probably does have something to do
with Emma's disappearance, though...<End>
Talk to the sheriff.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew? The sheriff's out investigating
the burglary.<End>
Did you find out anything?<End>
Nothing seems to have been taken...<End>
The Sheriff seems to think it was just
Sarah having an attack of the vapours.<End>
Poor Sarah...<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew? The sheriff's out on patrol.<End>
Yes, he probably won't be back until 6pm.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
Matthew? The sheriff's right here.
Should I patch you through?<End>
No, I just wondered if there'd been
any updates on the burglary.<End>
Someone's come forward to say they
saw someone fleeing from behind the
Rowlands' on a motorbike.<End>
I see...<End>
It must have something to do with
Emma's disappearance.<End>
Hello, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department.<End>
What's up, Matthew?<End>
Any updates on the burglary situation?<End>
We've gotten reports of a suspicious 
individual riding a motorbike.
But that's about all.<End>
I see.<End>
Well, we're still investigating.
It might have something to do with
Emma being missing.<End>
Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's Department.
What is it?<End>
Sheriff Morgan?
No, everyone's gone home for the day.
It's just me left, doing the night shift.<End>
If you've got business, wait until
tomorrow.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department...<End>
Huh? Sheriff Morgan?
He went home ages ago.<End>
I'm the only one still here at this time
of night.<End>
Yes, Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's
Department...<End>
You again, kid?
I told you already, there's no one here.<End>
Is this urgent?
If not, don't bother to call.<End>
Mizzurna Falls Sheriff's Department...
Huh? Morgan?
I'm the only one here at this hour!<End>
If it's an emergency, call ×××□
and bother Mary Lou.<End>
