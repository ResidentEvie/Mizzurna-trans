What's that?<End>
Do you have any ideas?<End>
Huh, you mean you don't know?<End>
N-No, you tell me?<End>
I'm not good with technology...<End>
Hahaha, you should ask Mary Lou.<End>
Ask Mary Lou.<End>
Isabella's song, huh.<End>
Have you ever heard it?<End>
Yes, of course. I think.
Her music is amazing.<End>
Maybe I'll become a fan of hers, too.<End>
Hmm?
You want something, Matthew?<End>
Playing detective again?<End>
Showing this to Morgan will just
complicate things...<End>
Uh, no, I'll come back later.<End>
I see.
Strange boy.<End>
If I show this to Morgan, he'll just give
me a hard time.<End>
So Mel wrote this? He used the motel...<End>
Well, that in itself isn't much to go on.
I can't do anything with this.<End>
If we at least had the date...<End>
Matthew, I don't mind you helping to find
Emma, but you'd better not be going into
people's houses uninvited.<End>
What's with the camera?<End>
It was in Emma's locker.<End>
What?<End>
I might be able to find out where Emma's
gone.<End>
Right! We should get those developed
straight away.<End>
I'll go get them developed.<End>
All right, bring them as soon as they're
done.<End>
Here's some money for the photo shop.<End>
Thanks.<End>
Bring them straight by.<End>
How do you like it?<End>
It's great. Thanks again.<End>
Hahaha... no problem.<End>
Hudson and Mary Lou said I should show
a bit more trust in you.<End>
Haha... thanks.<End>
You're more capable than I'd thought.<End>
I found this ring at Emma's place.<End>
I wonder who it belongs to...<End>
A letter I...

One of her classmates?<End>
Was there anyone in her class whose
name began with I...?<End>
Think about it?<End>
Guess this means that Kathy and Emma
did know each other.<End>
I hate to think it, but it looks like the two
of them went to the forest bringing the
Epoch with them.<End>
The crucial issue here is, who else was 
with them at the forest?<End>
Mel's the obvious choice, but if we
believe his testimony, he wasn't with
them.<End>
Still, they deliberately headed to the
forest. Why?
If they were doing something suspicious, <New>
there's other places they could have
chosen.<End>
What's with these pills?<End>
I found them in the motel room last used
by Mel and the girls.<End>
Okay, tell me everything.<End>
I see...<End>
I don't know what kind of drugs they are,
but I bet Samuel will find out if we ask
him.<End>
Yeah. For all his faults, he's still a
doctor.<End>
Tell me as soon as the results come in.<End>
What's this?<End>
It's one of the photos from the camera in
Emma's locker.<End>
These are Emma's photos?<End>
This is the off-limits area in the forest.
What's in there?<End>
It's a cave painting left by the native
tribespeople.<End>
A cave painting? Why does that need to
be blocked off from the public?<End>
I'm the one who blocked it off, true, but
it was the government who gave the
order.<End>
The government?!
...It's that important?<End>
I don't know. I doubt it.
I just did what I was ordered to do.<End>
So Emma went in there, huh...<End>
So it's in an actual cave?<End>
Yeah. It's not really a cave, more of a
dug-out area in the rock there.<End>
I bet the photo that came out all black
was when Emma tried to take a photo of
the wall painting, in the dark cave!<End>
Well, if Emma went inside, I'd better go
and check it out.<End>
Can I come, too? I want to go inside.<End>
...<End>
I know Emma was in there!
I want to know why...<End>
Well... all right.<End>
Can we go right now?<End>
No, not right now.
Let's see... meet me in front of the
waterfall in two hours' time.<End>
All right.<End>
Do you know what this is?<End>
Huh?
What are you doing with this envelope?<End>
I got it from Cohen.<End>
Hmm... I see.<End>
I don't know. Stop waving it at me.<End>
What are you doing? You're underage.<End>
Uh, no!
These aren't for me.<End>
I won't have you smoking, Matthew.<End>
If I see you with a lit cigarette,
I'm confiscating them.<End>
What's with this key?<End>
If it's for lost and found, I'll take it.<End>
No...<End>
Are you sure you don't want me to take
it?<End>
You got this back from James?<End>
I'm just taking charge of it for a while.<End>
All right, fine. First James, now you.
What do you need it for?<End>
What's so special about that old thing?<End>
