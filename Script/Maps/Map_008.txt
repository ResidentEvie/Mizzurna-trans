Do you know anything about this?<End>
I don't think so... why?<End>
I found it in Emma's locker.<End>
Hmm, in Emma's locker?<End>
I don't know if that's got anything to do
with why she's missing, but...<End>
I see... I'm sorry.
I'm not really a fan of computers.<End>
Perhaps you should ask someone who
might use one regularly.<End>
How about asking someone else?<End>
Isabella? The mysterious singer?<End>
It seems Emma liked her singing.<End>
Emma did...?<End>
I've heard her singing before.<End>
It gave me a sort of sad feeling inside.<End>
I know what you mean.<End>
You can tell a lot about how the singer's
feeling, just from their performance.<End>
Miss Holden, have you seen this type of
key before?<End>
It looks like a student locker key to me.<End>
What about it?<End>
I found it in Emma's room and borrowed
it.<End>
Can you let me look around the school?<End>
Matthew...
Please leave the investigation to Morgan.<End>
I know how you feel...<End>
The main school building is currently
off-limits.
I can't let you in there.<End>
I can't let you into the main school
building right now. You'll have to
investigate the key some other time...<End>
What's wrong, Matthew?<End>
Please take a look at this note.<End>
"9pm, motel"...<End>
The Lakeside Motel?<End>
What's it about?
I don't know...<End>
What is it?<End>
What's this?<End>
I found it in Emma's locker.<End>
In Emma's locker, you say?<End>
Matthew, listen to me.<End>
You should have handed this over to
Morgan.<End>
Give that to Morgan.<End>
I heard!<End>
If Morgan says it's okay, I guess it's
okay. But don't go doing anything
dangerous!<End>
All right.<End>
If you're in any danger, call Morgan
immediately.
You're still a high school student.<End>
Yes...<End>
I worry about you...<End>
You, with a ring? I wouldn't have
expected that.<End>
It seems it was Emma's.
Or at least, she had it.<End>
I see.
Oh, there's a letter engraved on it.<End>
"I"...
How unusual.<End>
I don't think there's a student here
whose name begins with I.<End>
What about among Emma's other
friends?<End>
So... they were meeting each other.<End>
But what could have made them want to
go to the forest together?<End>
I can't figure it out.<End>
Perhaps it was some religious thing?<End>
That could be the connection...<End>
You shouldn't take pills, Matthew.<End>
A healthy lifestyle should prevent
anyone from getting sick.<End>
I'd take medicine if I was really sick,
though.<End>
What?<End>
Don't do anything dangerous...<End>
This is the off-limits area, isn't it?<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
There's some sort of tribal cave
painting in there.<End>
But don't you go trespassing in there.<End>
Do you know anything about this?<End>
It says... Project Mizzurna.
I wonder what this is?<End>
It's very important-sounding...
Don't go getting yourself involved in
anything dangerous.<End>
Please be careful.<End>
Matthew Williams!!!
You're underage!<End>
I'm giving these to Barbara.<End>
...Really?
You really shouldn't smoke at your age,
you know.<End>
Please, don't start smoking.<End>
Hmm, a key?<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
I don't think so?<End>
I've never seen it before.<End>
Do you know what this is?<End>
It looks like a native tribal talisman.<End>
Very old-looking.
Impressive...<End>
Where did you get that?<End>
