No answer... guess he's not home.
I'll call back later.<End>
He must be asleep already.
I should call another time.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew?
If you want to talk, come to my lodge.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew?
I'll be at my lodge until around noon.
<End>
Let's talk about this morning.<End>
Okay.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew?
We're about to sweep the forest.<End>
Was Emma attacked by the bear?
What link is there between her and
what happened to Kathy?<End>
I hope we find some answers in the
forest...
We'll search until it gets dark.<End>
Okay.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew, you may have heard.
We found evidence of a bear in the
forest.<End>
We didn't find any leads on Emma, but
we've confirmed that Kathy was
definitely attacked by a bear.<End>
Morgan's following up some leads on
Emma.
You should talk to him.<End>
I have to prepare for tomorrow, so I'm
heading back into the forest later.<End>
I see.<End>
I'll be at my lodge for a while.<End>
All right.<End>
Hello, who's calling at this hour?<End>
Matthew, I know you're worried about
Emma, but it's late.<End>
I was in bed. Tomorrow's going to be an
early start, after all.<End>
I'm sorry.<End>
Let's leave this until tomorrow.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew. Good morning.<End>
Almost time for the bear hunt.
I have to head out.<End>
Let's do this later.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew...<End>
Yes, I'm fine.
Beast gave me quite a whack.<End>
We may have caught the bear, but I can't
rest easy. I'll be heading back to the
forest in a bit.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew, I was just at the forest
earlier. It's oddly quiet in there.<End>
There was no hint of that terrible
feeling I had on the night of the 24th.<End>
Probably just relief now we've caught
the bear.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Good morning, Matthew.<End>
Hmm, me? I'll be heading to the forest
soon.<End>
I'll be back later, though.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew, I have some business at the
sheriff's department.
I was just walking out the front door.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew, what's up?
No point speaking over the phone.<End>
Come to the lodge.
I'll be home until the evening.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew?
Have you been trying to reach me?<End>
Sorry, I was out investigating something.<End>
Matthew, I believe there's some deeply
hidden connection between Emma and
Kathy.<End>
But I shouldn't make statements like
that without evidence... forget I said
that.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew... sorry, I was just
contemplating something.<End>
Matthew, I wonder if karma really
exists...<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew? I heard from Morgan.
You're doing some investigating, aren't
you?<End>
You're a smart man, so you'll
understand me here.
Work with Morgan on whatever you find.<New>
Don't go striking out alone.<End>
This is Cohen. Who's speaking?<End>
Matthew...<End>
It's my belief that Emma and Kathy went
to the forest on the night of the 24th
to do... something.<End>
But what...?<End>
If it's what I'm thinking, then...<End>
No... no, they wouldn't... would they?<End>
This is Cohen...<End>
Matthew... Hmm? Yes... the forest
feels... truly ominous today.<End>
Yes...
Just like how it was on the 24th...<End>
I've got a bad feeling...
I hope I'm mistaken, but if I'm not...<End>
