Huh?
A burglar?<End>
I'm worried about Sarah...
I'm going to Emma's house right now...<End>

Winona? What's up?<End>
Today's Kathy's funeral, isn't it?
I'm thinking of going. What about you?<End>
I'll go too. Shall I pick you up in my car?<End>
It's all right, I'll walk there.
Let's meet at the cemetery.<End>
All right.<End>
Who is it?<End>
It's Winona. Can you meet me now?<End>
Sure, but what's up?<End>
Let's talk in person.
I'll be at the boat house. Can you come?<End>

Matthew?<End>
Winona? What's up?<End>
I just heard. Mel's going to be released.<End>
Released?! Why?<End>
Dennis posted the bail money.<End>
I see...<End>
Mel is probably gonna come after you...<End>
Thanks.
I can take care of myself, though.<End>
But...<End>
Don't worry!
...When is he getting out?<End>
I don't know...
He might already be free...<End>
All right.
I'm going to see Morgan.<End>
Okay... please... be careful.<End>
Sure.<End>
Is that Matthew Williams?<End>
Yes, what is it?<End>
It's Samuel. About those drugs you
asked me to identify. Where did you
get them?<End>
Uh... where...?<End>
Well, never mind. Just come to the
hospital director's office as fast
as you can.<End>
All right...<End>
Hello!<End>

What's up?<End>
I've got an unusual customer.
Doctor James.
Anyway, come to the store.<End>
Yes?<End>
Matthew...?<End>

Where are you?<End>
My... my ring... if you show it...<End>
What?!  I can't hear you!
What about a ring?<End>
Matthew... please...<End>
Isabella!
