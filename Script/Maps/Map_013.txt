Isn't this a computer disk?<End>
Do you know about computers?<End>
Not even in the slightest.
I don't even know anyone who owns
a computer.<End>
Hmm.<End>
Hmm?<End>
What are you even showing me this for?<End>
Emma loved Isabella's songs.<End>
Isabella, huh...<End>
I don't really like her...<End>
Why not?<End>
She's got this gloomy face, like she has
the weight of the world on her
shoulders.<End>
Don't you find her depressing?<End>
I've never really talked to her, though.<End>
Huh, you found this in Emma's room?<End>
Yeah.<End>
I bet whatever it unlocks will have some
clues...<End>
But I have no idea what it might unlock.<End>
I feel like I've seen it before, though...<End>
Well if you've seen it, maybe Winona
has, too. You should ask her.<End>
I bet you can find out something.<End>
Hey, Matthew...
You're staying at the motel?<End>
I thought you had your own sweet
bachelor pad.<End>
No, it's not me...
I think Mel was staying there.<End>
...Him? What would he need a motel
room for?<End>
And at night?
Just who would he be meeting in a
motel room at night?!<End>
Stupid Mel...
He just keeps digging himself a deeper
hole.<End>
Matthew, this is a diner.
We don't develop photos here.<End>
The photo shop is across the street.
Get it together, dude.<End>
To get to the photo shop, leave here and
cross the street to Central Square.<End>
What's that for?<End>
Morgan gave it to me. He still doesn't
seem to appreciate my help, though.<End>
But this is kinda like he's accepted you
as an officer!<End>
Maybe you could blag your way onto
crime scenes with that.<End>
Hmm, maybe...<End>
I bet it would work!<End>
I mean, if I was a cop...
I'd flash my badge to anyone who stood
in my way!<End>
Hmm, what's that ring?<End>
Found it in Emma's house.<End>
I've seen the same ring design before.<End>
Where?<End>
One of our customers was wearing it.<End>
It's got a letter engraved on, right?
I remember 'cause it was kinda unusual.<End>
Did that ring have a letter I on it as
well?<End>
I don't think it was an I...<End>
But you know... I didn't like that
customer.
Kinda creepy.<End>
Hmm, it's odd...
The ring doesn't look store bought...
it looks more like someone made it...<End>
So! Their movements match up!<End>
But this is a Wolves flyer.
I wonder if Kathy went to Wolves...<End>
I can't picture her knocking back booze
at the bar somehow.
I wonder who she was with...?<End>
Must have been Emma.<End>
But if she was with Emma, would she
write "24th, at woods with Emma"...?<End>
Maybe they met on another occasion,
not at the bar, and she just had this
flyer so used it for paper?<End>
You may have a point there.<End>
So Kathy must have had wild child
friends too.<End>
You okay? Caught a cold or something?<End>
Maybe I shouldn't tell Lorraine about
Mel being at the motel with the girls...<End>
That's not cold medicine?<End>
That's the part of the forest that's
off-limits, isn't it?<End>
You know it?<End>
Yes, there's supposed to be some native
tribal painting in there.<End>
I wonder why it's been placed off-limits.
Is it dangerous or something?<End>
I wonder.<End>
Still, it's just a sign. If anyone really
wanted to go in, it probably wouldn't
stop them.<End>
True.<End>
I bet Emma went in there, huh?<End>
I know you're not originally from town,
Matthew, so maybe you don't know this...<End>
But that place wasn't always off-limits.<End>
Do you know what this is?<End>
Hmm, this?
The title says Project Mizzurna.<End>
Sounds heavy.
But it's got nothing to do with me.<End>
Never heard it mentioned in the diner, 
either.<End>
Yikes, Matthew, you smoke?<End>
No, these are a present.
Do you smoke, Lorraine?<End>
Sometimes, when Mel pisses me off.
For stress relief.
You don't like girls who smoke?<End>
It's your prerogative. But if you smoke
too much, you might end up like some old
ladies I could mention.<End>
What's that?<End>
You said they're a present, right?
Better hurry up and give them away.<End>
What's with the key?<End>
It's the key to Cohen's lodge.<End>
Cohen, he's the one who found Kathy,
right?<End>
He's always in the forest. Wonder
what he does in there.<End>
Matthew, that key goes in a lock, not
on my counter.<End>
The Death Journey Ritual...<End>
Sounds so ominous.
People who believe in that stuff must be
touched in the head.<End>
That doctor, James, he's pretty ominous
himself, isn't he?<End>
No, not at all. Sure, his thought
processes are a little different.
But he's really smart, a genius.<End>
Huh.<End>
It's an old necklace. Big deal.<End>
