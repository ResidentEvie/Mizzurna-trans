What's this?<End>
It was in Emma's locker.<End>
Oh, my!
Emma's secrets must lie within!<End>
Hurry up and investigate it!<End>
You don't have to tell me, I already am.<End>
What's that you say?<End>
Hurry up and figure out what it means!<End>
Isabella's song?<End>
It was Emma's favourite.<End>
What do you expect me to do with a tape,
boy?<End>
You inconsiderate child.
At least bring a tape player!<End>
If you want to hear it so bad, I will.<End>
Hmph, I don't care either way.<End>
...<End>
Now, Elvis Presley, he made some REAL
music!
Everything else is just noise!<End>
Hoo hoo!
So you found this in Emma's room?<End>
And you want to know what it unlocks?<End>
...Do you know?<End>
How should I know, silly boy?!<End>
But, there's a way to find out.<End>
What's that?<End>
Try it in every lock in town!<End>
That's ridiculous...<End>
Happy hunting!<End>
The motel?
You mean the Lakeside Motel?<End>
Yeah.<End>
The fellow who runs the place has
nothing to do.<End>
Not many people pass through this town,
you know.<End>
I guess you're right.<End>
I doubt that place makes a lick of profit.<End>
What are you doing, bringing a camera
into a hospital?<End>
Er, am I not allowed?<End>
Are you here to snap creepy pictures of
the nurses?!<End>
N-No!<End>
It must be Jennifer, from the nurse's
centre. I see!<End>
Huh?<End>
Hmm... 
But if you ask me, the girl at
reception is the real looker.<End>
Listen, you've got it all wrong...<End>
I hope you're not planning to take
upskirt shots on the stairs!<End>
You're not listening...<End>
Don't go taking snaps of ME!<End>
Huh?
Are you a police officer, now?<End>
No, it's nothing like that, just a gift from
Morgan.<End>
What use is it?<End>
Erm... well...<End>
Hmmph...<End>
What's wrong?<End>
I just hope you're not going to use it for
something illegal.<End>
I wouldn't do that!<End>
Oh, it was only a joke!<End>
Don't go acting like a bigshot just 'cause
you've got a badge!<End>
What? What's this ring?<End>
Well, it was Emma's...<End>
That's odd...<End>
What? Is there something weird about
it?<End>
It's got an I written on it.
That's got nothing to do with Emma.<End>
Yes, but...<End>
Does she have any friends whose names
begin with I?<End>
Hmm, I...<End>
Not too many names begin with I.<End>
Looks like Kathy and Emma went to the
forest together that day.<End>
Yes...<End>
...<End>
I think I may have done a bad thing.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
Granny Barbara told her! I told her not
to listen to the old tales...<End>
?<End>
Nothing.<End>
Oh, Emma...
...I said it's nothing.<End>
Are you trying to give me medicine, boy?<End>
No, that's not what I...<End>
I won't touch drugs.
They're not natural.<End>
They oughtn't to be put into the body.
Illness must be overcome by willpower
alone.<End>
Why is this old lady in a hospital in the
first place...?<End>
You! No drugs! Only willpower!<End>
Emma was in here.<End>
I'm not really sure about that.<End>
No, she was. I know it.
She went in, and then...
she made up her mind...<End>
What are you talking about?<End>
This painting... it was left by the ancient
people...<End>
The world depicted in it... it's a world
we people living today don't
understand...<End>
Have you seen this cave painting before?<End>
...<End>
Matthew, how long do you think I have
left to live?<End>
Please don't ask me strange questions.<End>
I might die tomorrow.
 I might live to a
hundred.
But one thing's for sure,
I'll die some day.<End>
No matter how much I might not want to.
That's just nature...<End>
That cave... you start thinking strange
things in there.<End>
If that thing wasn't in this town, then
maybe...
No, never mind.<End>
What's this? It looks like a very official
sort of envelope.<End>
Cohen asked me to bring it.
<End>
It gives off the stink of secrecy.
Have you looked inside it?<End>
No, I thought I'd better not.<End>
That's right. He only asked you to bring
it, not to pry.
But you know, if it were me...<End>
No, I'm not doing it!<End>
...All right, all right. So uptight!<End>
Go deliver it to him then!<End>
Ooh, cigarettes!
So you finally brought the goods.<End>
Yes, yes...
Blue in the Face, an excellent brand...<End>
You shouldn't smoke too much.<End>
Why not?<End>
Um, it shortens life expectancy?<End>
I'd rather enjoy my time on earth than
prolong it in tedium.<End>
Liz seems upset.<End>
Oh, don't exaggerate. I don't cause her
THAT much grief.<End>
Although giving her a hard time is my
one pleasure in life right now.<End>
What's this?<End>
It's the key to Cohen's lodge.<End>
Then, go and put it in the door there.

What are you showing it to me for?<End>
Oh, I guess you're right.<End>
You're a bit of an odd duck, aren't you?
Flashing your random trinkets around.<End>
Do you know what that necklace is for?<End>
I can tell you now, it doesn't have any
spiritual power.
It's just a piece of junk.<End>
I don't understand the mentality of
people who are interested in stuff
like that...<End>
...<End>
And I don't want to know, either!<End>
Throw it away!
Nothing good can come of holding onto it.<End>
