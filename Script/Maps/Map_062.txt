No one's picking up.
I'll call back later.<End>
It's out of business hours, so Uncle's
probably at The Ruins...<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Hmm? Matthew?<End>
I have a customer right now.
Call back later.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? What's up?<End>
Has anyone called by for me?<End>
No, no one's called for you.<End>
Besides, I'm out of here from noon.
Got that big meeting at the church.<End>
We're going to decide what to do about
that bear.
You watch the store, you hear?<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew?
I'm just leaving.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew, I just got back from the
meeting.
But I'm off out again soon.<End>
We're going to sweep the forest.<End>
So much to do!
See you later.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? I'm busy preparing for
tomorrow. This is a bear we're up
against, you know.<End>
Hurry home, stop messing about.<End>
You hear me? I'm hanging up now.<End>
Matthew?<End>
I'm closing up shop now.
That's all.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew?<End>
I'm glad the bear hunt went off all right.<End>
Of course.
I was there. Nothing to worry about.<End>
Still, we didn't find Emma.
That's the downer here.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? I heard you asked the
Grouver doctor about the bear.<End>
It's definitely the bear that mauled
Kathy.<End>
But we also can't rule out its
involvement in whatever's happened
to Emma.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew?
I'm about to close up shop.<End>
Keep an eye on the place, all right?<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? You want to know if anyone's
come by for you?<End>
No, no one's come by. I'll call your cell if
anything comes up, don't worry.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Why don't you stop tooling
around town and help out with the store
now and then?<End>
Miss Holden came by earlier, all
worried.<End>
I crumble in the presence of such a
lovely woman.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew, not too many people out on the
streets these days.<End>
No one's coming into the store!
And yet the diner's getting plenty of
business! What gives!<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Did you find out anything about
Emma?<End>
If you see Morgan, tell him to stop by the
store more often.
I'm so bored!!!<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew?
Winona was just here, did you see her?<End>
Poor girl doesn't know what to do with
herself.
You be a good friend to her, you hear?<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? I'm closing up a little early
today.<End>
I'm going to see Morgan.<End>
I'll be back at The Ruins around 10. Call
me if there's a problem with the store.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Seems this year's ending on a
new low for this town.<End>
It's New Year's Eve. A chance for a
clean state.<End>
Can't carry last year's baggage into the
new year.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? I've got a rare visitor!<End>
Who, you say? Come and see!<End>
He's wearing that "permanent stress"
face.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Stop goofing off all over town.<End>
Help me out in the store, would you?<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew, Miss Holden is here.<End>
She's worried about you!<End>
You've got a good teacher, you know.<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Miss Holden's still here.
Says she's off to the hospital after this.<End>
Barbara's lucky to have such a nice,
helpful granddaughter...<End>
...<End>
Yeah, you heard me!<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew? Hmm, haven't seen Winona
today.<End>
Miss Holden's worried about you both.<End>
You can handle yourself, but if anything
happens to that young lady...<End>
Captain Nozz's General Goods!<End>
Matthew, I'm done here so I'm heading
to The Ruins.<End>
I know it's New Year's Eve, but come
straight home.<End>
