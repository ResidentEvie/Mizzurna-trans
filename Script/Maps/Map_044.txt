How is Cohen?<End>
It's all right, he's just got a touch of
exhaustion.
Seems he hasn't been sleeping lately.<End>
Can I speak with him?<End>
No, he's resting now.

Come back later.

I plan to keep him here for a while.<End>
But you said it's just exhaustion...<End>
Well, yes, but he's an old man.

We have to consider the needs of each
patient carefully.
 What on earth has he<New>
 been doing to have made himself
collapse like that...?<End>
Are you all right?<End>
Matthew, thanks for saving me.<End>
I'm afraid I broke the lock on your
window.<End>
Haha, never mind about that.<End>
Morgan was really worried.<End>
Oh yes, he gave me a lecture on taking
better care of my health.<End>
Uh, why has the forest been placed
off-limits?<End>
Oh, that...<End>
The forest is strange right now.

It feels like something bad is going to
happen there. 
Not a good answer?<End>
What do you mean by something bad?<End>
That, I don't know.

But it's the same feeling as on the night
of the 24th.<End>
What are you overseeing the forest for?<End>
Hmm...<End>

...<End>
Matthew, I have a favour to ask.

There's an envelope on the desk in my
room. Could you go and get it?<End>
An envelope? 
Sure, I don't mind.<End>
It's very important.

Bring it to me, and I'll tell you about the
forest.<End>
That's the key to my lodge.<End>
All right.<End>
Thanks.<End>
You got the Lodge Key<End>
Is this the envelope?<End>
Thanks. You've been a big help.<End>
It says Project Mizzurna.
Mizzurna means it's got something to do
with this town, right?<End>
...Yes. 
Did you look inside?<End>
No, I had the feeling I shouldn't.<End>
I see.<End>
Does this have something to do with you
overseeing the forest?<End>
...<End>
If it's a military secret, I understand.<End>
No, it's not really something that needs
to be a secret anymore.

It was a long time ago.<End>
You know I was in the military until five
years ago, right?<End>
Yes, you were a colonel.<End>
Back then, I was assigned to Los Alamos,
New Mexico. By coincidence, I saw this
file. When I read it, I realised it was<New>
a report of the case that happened here
way back when.<End>
You mean 40 years ago, the murder
committed by Cougar?<End>
You know about it?<End>
Yeah, he killed someone to perform the
Death Journey Ritual.<End>
Right.<End>
Barbara said that the police back then
were overwhelmed,
 and that the military
did all kinds of investigations. <End>
They weren't just investigating the
murder. They were investigating the
ritual itself. 
I got interested in the case.<New>
After my assignment was finished, I
decided to find out for myself what
happened in the forest here.<End>
So that's why you're investigating the
forest.<End>
The entire Cougar case hinges on this
town's forest.<End>
You said before, that when you found
Kathy,
 there were signs nearby like
perhaps a ritual took place.<New>

So, was that the Death Journey Ritual?<End>
That's what I thought.
 But there's no
proof. 
Nothing left that could be
connected to the Death Journey Ritual.<End>
Something connected to the ritual...

what about the necklace that was caught
in the bear's claws?<End>
Necklace?!

You found something like that?

I didn't know about that!<End>
Yeah, like a native tribal design.
I think it was Kathy's. <End>
That's the Prophet necklace.<End>
What's the Prophet necklace?<End>
The dead person who takes the death
journey needs the prophet to show him
the way. <End>
So, that would be the guy who's standing
up on the mural, right?<End>
Right. The "prophet" puts on the necklace,
and he then receives the life-force of
the earth. <End>
So then, Kathy and Emma DID do the
ritual that day!<End>
So it would seem.
...No, in fact, there's no doubt about it.

They performed the ritual, but as a<New>
complete coincidence,
 they were
attacked by a bear in the middle of it.<End>
They... they did the ritual...<End>
Matthew, go and tell all this to Morgan,
and ask him to come here.<Unk70><End>
Okay.<End>
