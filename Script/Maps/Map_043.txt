How about some music?<End>
What kind of music?<End>
It's a wonderful song.<End>
?!
This song...<End>
Do you know it?

<End>
...<End>
Why do you have this song?<End>
It's a song by Isabella.
She's in the next room to you.<End>
...Her...?<End>
Is there something strange about this
song?<End>
When I was in the military, I heard that
same melody.<End>
What, this one? 
What do you mean?<End>
...I said before how the military was
investigating the Death Journey ritual,
right? <End>
Yeah.<End>
Why do you think they were doing that?<End>
Because it was part of the murder
investigation, right?<End>
No, the opposite.<End>
Back then, the military was running all
sorts of tests on post-death
experiences.<End>
Post... death experiences?<End>
Yes. Placing a person in a state of
death, then reviving them with electric
jolts.<End>
That's...! 
That's exactly the  same thing
as the Death Journey Ritual!<End>
Yes. 
The ritual Cougar was
experimenting with, was no different
to ours.<End>
Then...?<End>
I was involved with the case for 20
years...<End>
So, then...
...The experiments didn't go well?<End>
No, they went very well.
<End>
The test subjects indeed died and were
brought back to the land of the living.<End>
And they really experienced a world
beyond death?<End>
Of that, there can be no doubt...
<End>
I know, because I was one of the test
subjects.<End>
...You?<End>
Yes. It was... such a strange world...
<End>
So warm... so vast...
<End>
And everywhere, a beautiful melody
playing...<End>
And that melody, is the one from this
song, right?<End>
...Yes.<End>
Isabella also had a near death
experience, and she said that she heard
this melody while she was under,<New>
and made it into a song.<End>
Is that so...<End>
Is there... really a world after death?<End>
Maybe this song is the song of God...
or maybe it's just part of our DNA.<End>
Some memory left over from long ago.<End>
Is it really so important to see this
world beyond death?<End>
I wonder...<End>
I think it was something beyond the scope
of our experiments.<End>
Many test subjects died.<End>
Maybe we were no better than Cougar.<End>
But... Cougar believed he could get
divine power.
 Even though there's no
evidence of that at all!<End>
It's all the same.
 We believed in science.
He believed in ancient traditions.
In the existence of the divine.<End>
...<End>
About the necklace found on the bear.
Do you have it?<End>
Yes, I just borrowed it from Morgan so I
could examine it.<End>
So, it's the Prophet's necklace?<End>
No doubt about it.<End>
Could you show it to me again?<End>
I'm wearing it around my neck.

Go ahead and take it.<End>
Why are you wearing it?<End>
I was wondering if it would give me any
strange powers.<End>
?!<End>
You've got a huge wound back here...

what happened?<End>
?!
Oh! Yes... that wound...
it's from a while
ago...<End>
It looks like a scratch... <End>
Got it!<End>
Can I borrow this?<End>
...What for?<End>
Well...
I just feel like if I keep it, I'll be
able to see Emma...<End>
Liar.
<End>
You think there was someone else
involved in the ritual
 besides Emma
and Kathy, don't you?<End>
And you think that person still needs the
necklace.<End>
Why are you...<End>
I jumped to the same conclusion you did.<End>
...Yes, it's like you said.<End>
Well, whatever.
 Just promise you'll give
it back to me if I need to examine it
again.<End>
Sure.<End>
You got the Prophet Necklace<End>
Welcome...?<End>
Loretta?<End>
Yeah... 
oh, I've  seen you somewhere
before,  haven't I?<End>
At Kathy's funeral.<End>
Well, whatever.<End>
I want to talk about Kathy. Do you mind?<End>
...Kathy?<End>
There's nothing really to talk about.<End>
I think Kathy was in some sort of trouble.<End>
You know a side to Kathy that we don't.
Don't you?<End>
...<End>
Is it something that's hard to talk about?<End>
Yeah, well. 
At any rate, I can't talk here.<End>
You never know where that priest's
lurking.<End>
Priest? You mean Father Barton?!<End>
Look, I'm at work.
<End>
Give me your phone number.

I'll contact you later.<End>
Thanks.<End>
