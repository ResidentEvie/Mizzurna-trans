Oh, Matthew.<End>
Miss Holden! Why are you here?<End>
Why not? 
What's wrong with a
granddaughter visiting her sick granny?<End>
Granddaughter? Then...<End>
Yes, this is my grandmother.<End>
I see...<End>
If this is your student, doesn't that mean
he's in the same year as Emma?<End>
You know Emma?<End>
Emma used to visit granny.<End>
Emma was a nice girl. 
Poor thing.<End>
It's not like she's dead.<End>
That's right, granny, we don't know yet. <End>
I see, I see...<End>
Did Emma visit often?<End>
Yes, Emma had an interest in hearing
granny's tales of the olden days.<End>

Tales of the olden days?<End>
Not nice tales for the telling.<End>
...<End>
Truly, they're not.<End>
I see...<End>
Maybe I'll tell you... if you come and see
me sometimes.<End>
Granny, not that again...<End>
Come in!<End>
Oh, there you are.<End>
Morgan? 
What are you doing here?<End>
Samuel asked me to come. I just got
here.<End>
Why?<End>
I explained about the drugs, right?<End>
Yes. You said Matthew asked you to
identify them.<End>
Well, I checked them out...
 don't be
shocked, now...<End>
Just spit it out.<End>
Whoever takes that drug will
experience a powerful hallucinogenic
trip!<End>
?!<End>
Hey! What's the meaning of this?<End>
I could explain, but I doubt you'd get it.

It's "Epoch", a drug popular on the west
coast 
in the latter half of the sixties.<End>
What I want to know is what something
like that is doing here!!!<End>
Ask Matthew.

I want to know myself, actually.<End>
Matthew! Where did you get this?!<End>
Well...<End>
I see...<End>
What the hell...
 this Epoch... in this town!<End>
...<End>
I can't believe it... What the hell is going
on...
 this is Mizzurna Falls, for crying
out loud!<End>
Looks like Kathy and Emma were into
some heavy stuff. 
I guess we're not
talking about bears anymore.<End>
I bet it was Mel's! 
Then he needed
money to pay for it, so he robbed the
diner! <End>
Yes, his behaviour is all starting to make
sense now. 
Why he stole Emma's diary,

why he robbed the diner...<End>
Let's just arrest Mel!<End>
I can't believe this is how Kathy and
Emma were linked...<End>
Matthew.<End>
How's Isabella's condition?<End>
I see...<End>
You're keen.<End>
?!<End>
Hasn't she regained consciousness yet?<End>
No...<End>
If she doesn't hurry up and get better
soon, the bar's gonna lose customers.<End>
How dare you.
 You're partly responsible
for this happening to her, you know.<End>
I know. It was a joke.<End>
Guess I'll come back later.<End>
Isn't that the bar owner?<End>
Yeah...<End>
He just watched Dennis manipulate
Isabella, and didn't do anything.<End>
When I went to the bar with Emma that
one time, I told you some guy was
hitting on her, right?<End>
Yeah.<End>
Well, that guy saved her.<End>
What, Wolf did?
<End>
Hmm, well, I guess it is his bar. He
probably had to step in.
But, he was sort of weird about it.<New>
Overly concerned with Emma's health.<End>
Like she was a precious thing he didn't
want damaged...<End>
