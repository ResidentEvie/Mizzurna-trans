Nobody's picking up.
Guess I'll call back later.<End>
Nobody's picking up.

They must have gone to bed...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...
Thank you for checking up on us...<End>
But I don't want to leave Sarah's side
right now.<End>
Okay.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew... thanks for checking in.<End>
I'm just choosing to believe that Emma
will come home safe.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew...
Steve's not here.<End>
I... have odd thoughts when I'm alone...
I need to pull myself together...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew... good morning.<End>
Sarah's not recovered from her shock
yet...<End>
It's all right... time will heal everything.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Good morning, Matthew.<End>
Yes, Sarah's calmed down a lot.<End>
We have to believe that Emma will come
home safe.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew?
Thanks for checking in.<End>
Things are still bad, but we're trying
to stay positive.<End>
Emma's fine... she has to be.
Right, Matthew?<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...
Steve's out on mayoral business.<End>
He's been staying home for my sake,
but...<End>
I think he'll stop by Robert's on his way
home.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...
I've been busy with work today.<End>
It's such a relief that Sarah's better.<End>
I'll be home for a while.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Good evening, Matthew...
I'm alone right now. Steve has gone out.<End>
I wonder where he's gone...<End>
He puts on a brave face for me, but I
know he's hurting inside...<End>
Maybe he's gone somewhere to be
alone...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, Steve's gone out.<End>
He went to look at the noticeboard in the
central square.<End>
He's in charge of changing the notices
daily.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew? Steve said he was going to
the church.<End>
I think he's gone to pray for Emma...<End>
That's about all we can do...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew... yes, I'm still at home.<End>
Sarah worries if I'm away too long.<End>
Could you stop by and visit her, if you
have time?<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
I'll be home all day. Will you let me know
if there's any news on Emma?<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...
Another day, and Emma's still missing.<End>
With each day that passes, I lose hope
that she's still alive...<End>
But maybe tomorrow...<End>
I just wish I could see her...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, good morning.
It's the last day of the year...<End>
If Emma doesn't come home today, I get
the feeling I'll never see her alive
again...<End>
I'll have to start the new year in a
world without my daughter in it...<End>
Sarah...<End>
I'm sorry... I know I shouldn't lose hope...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, did you see Steve?<End>
I just feel so lonely, all alone...<End>
Sorry... I'm all right...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew... Steve's out.<End>
I don't know where...<End>
He may have gone to pray...<End>
He doesn't know what to do, either...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew, Steve's not home yet.<End>
He called to say he'd be stopping by the
sheriff's department.<End>
I know Morgan is doing everything he
can to find Emma.<End>
I can't blame him for anything...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew... I get so sad when I think
it's the last day of the year...<End>
I can't face the new year without
my baby...<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
Emma's not coming home today either,
is she...<End>
I'll be at home today.<End>
Hello, Rowland residence...<End>
Matthew?<End>
Yes, I'm all right.
It looks like we'll be seeing in the new
year just the two of us.<End>
I'm just hoping that next year, Emma will
be with us...
I have to believe that...<End>
