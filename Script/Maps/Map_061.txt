No one's picking up.
Guess it's kinda late.<End>
Yes, Ringwald's.<End>
Matthew? Hold on a sec.<End>
Yes, be right there.<End>
Sorry...
Dad's calling me.
Call me back later?<End>
Hi, you're through to

Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew, what's up?<End>
Uh... could you call back later?
I have a customer.<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Good morning, Matthew.
Winona left early this morning for the
school.<End>
Said she had something to do at the
library.<End>
Yes, yes, Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Huh? Robert's gone to fetch Winona.<End>
Said he was going to stop by the boat
house on their way back.<End>
He'd do anything for that girl.<End>
Well, Winona is a lovely young woman.
Yes, lovely...<End>
Yes, yes, Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh, it's you... Robert's not back yet.<End>
He just called actually, said he was going
to drop Winona off at some kid called
Matthew's house.<End>
Must be her boyfriend...
Lucky jerk...<End>
Hello?
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh Matthew. Winona's not home.<End>
I think she's probably at the sheriff's
department, or the school.<End>
She's got an inquisitive mind. I think she
intends to try to find Emma herself.
I hope she doesn't get into any trouble...<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew? What's up?<End>
Can you come out?<End>
Sorry, Dad's at Emma's house, so I have
to hold down the fort until he gets back.<End>
He said he'd be back this evening, but I
don't know when...<End>
You can come by if you like, though.<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew?
I'm manning the store.<End>
I can't leave until Dad gets home.<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh Matthew. Winona's in her room.<End>
I have no idea what she's up to. Do you?<End>
I don't want either of you getting into
trouble over what's happened with
Emma and Kathy...<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh, Matthew.
Winona's in her room.<End>
Probably asleep by now.<End>
I'm relieved she's safe at home.
It really brings me peace of mind.<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh, Matthew.
Winona's in her room.
Shall I get her?<End>
No, it can wait until tomorrow.<End>
Thanks.<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew...
Winona left early this morning.<End>
I think she's at the park. That's where
she's always gone when she's troubled,
ever since she was a child.<End>
Hello?
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Oh Matthew. Winona's not home.<End>
She said she was off to the sheriff's
department.
Why don't you head over there?<End>
Hello.
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew, Winona's out.
I thought she was with you...<End>
Where could she be...?<End>
Hello.
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew, Winona should be at the
hospital.<End>
I know the case is on her mind, but
I don't want her getting into trouble...<End>
Can you go and meet up with her?<End>
Ringwald's Gas Station.<End>
Matthew? Is Winona with you?<End>
She hasn't come home...<End>
Where is she, that she doesn't want me
to know about?<End>
Matthew, I'm really worried...
Can you try to find her?<End>
