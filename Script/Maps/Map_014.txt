Hmm, hmm? A disk?<End>
Do you know how to use it?<End>
Hmm, maybe a secretary or
receptionist would know.<End>
A... secretary or receptionist?<End>
Yeah, they use computers don't they?
Not that I know much about that.<End>
I told you already, I don't know about
that.<End>
I'd like to ask you about Isabella...<End>
Oh yeah, now that's what I call a classy
broad.<End>
Shame about the gloomy face, though.<End>
Do you have any idea why she's so down?<End>
Dunno. Doubt singing at a bar's all that
stressful, though.<End>
Maybe she's got man trouble?<End>
Oh, is that for lost and found?<End>
No, I think this was Emma's.<End>
Huh...
You didn't pick that up in the hospital
somewhere?<End>
I thought it was one of the keys to the
lockers in the locker room.<End>
I see...<End>
No ideas, huh.<End>
What's that?<End>
"9pm, motel"?<End>
What are you telling me, here?<End>
Uh... nothing, never mind.<End>
Something you want to ask me?<End>
What are you doing with that?<End>
You want to take a snap of me with that
camera?<End>
No, I don't...<End>
Don't be shy! Snap away!<End>
No, it's all right, really...<End>
I'll model for you anytime.<End>
Hmm, a police badge.<End>
I got it from Morgan.<End>
Let me try it on.
I bet it'd look great on me...<End>
...<End>
Still, nice little souvenir.<End>
I'm trying to find out whose ring this is.<End>
Huh... not a very sophisticated piece
of jewellery, is it?<End>
Not something I'd give to a lady.<End>
I prefer something with a nicely cut
gemstone myself.<End>
Uh...<End>
Plus, gold's always better than silver.<End>
You see, the gift is a representation
of one's devotion.<End>
Guess this is all too soon for you.<End>
Have you seen this bit of paper before?<End>
Hmm?
No, I don't know anything about that...<End>
This was in Kathy's locker, and it has
your office phone number on it.<End>
Huh?!<End>
Why would Kathy write your office phone
number down?<End>
I don't... listen... I...<End>
You know something about Kathy, don't
you?<End>
Oh, all right... listen... it's no big deal,
really...<End>
At the bar, a while back... Kathy and her
friend were there. I was drunk, you
understand...<New>
...and I just gave her my number.<End>
Her friend? Who was she with?<End>
Girl called Loretta.<End>
Loretta?
That's the girl I met at Kathy's funeral.<End>
Listen, it's not like I did anything with
her. We just had some drinks then
said goodnight. I swear!<End>
What do you know about Loretta?<End>
Her? I was wasted, I don't remember.
Hmm... but wait, there's something...<End>
Ah yes, that's it!
Loretta's the taco girl!<End>
Huh? Loretta's a... taco girl?<End>
No, no, she's not a taco GIRL.
She SELLS tacos.<End>
...<End>
What I mean is, she works at the taco
van in the afternoons. You know, that
yellow one parked in town?<End>
The taco van...<End>
Matthew, let's keep this our little
secret. About me and Kathy and her
friend. All right?<End>
Why?<End>
Because it makes me look bad!
I'm a doctor, you know!<End>
You should have thought about that
before you started hitting on them.<End>
Come on, Matthew!
Give me a break here!<End>
Don't tell anyone about me and Kathy.
All right? I'm begging you!<End>
Do you know what this is?<End>
Huh? What's this, then?<End>
They're not from the hospital pharmacy?<End>
All our drugs have the Grouver mark
on them.<End>
Would you be able to identify them for
me?<End>
Huh? That's a lot to ask, son!<End>
Please... I think it's important.<End>
Oh, all right.
I'll ask James, or Keith to do it.<End>
James knows about drugs?<End>
Yes, he's got a background in
pharmacology.<End>
I see...<End>
I'll call you with my findings.<End>
What's that photo, there?
Oh, that place?<End>
Do you know something about it?<End>
I'm not particularly interested.<End>
It's just a boring cave.<End>
Do you know anything about this?<End>
Looks like a fake envelope.<End>
What do you mean?<End>
There's probably a love letter inside...
Hahaha!<End>
...<End>
I wonder who the love letter is for?<End>
Hey hey! No smoking in the hospital!<End>
I'm not going to smoke them.<End>
Well, I'm not on break, so don't flash
them at me.<End>
I can't have one now.<End>
What's this?<End>
Nothing to do with me.<End>
I see.<End>
Nothing to do with me, you know?<End>
Look at these feathers!
Positively ancient!<End>
Do you know anything about this?<End>
Doesn't look like much of anything to me.
Probably some historian would pay a
bundle for it, though.<End>
I certainly wouldn't waste my money
on it.<End>
