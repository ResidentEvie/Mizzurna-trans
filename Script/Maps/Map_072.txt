No answer... guess no one's home.
I'll call back later.<End>
They must have gone to bed already.
I'll call another time.<End>
Lang residence. Who's calling?<End>
Matthew?<End>
Is this an emergency?
If not, come to the department tomorrow.<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Oh, good morning, Matthew.
We're just leaving.
If you need me, come to the department.<End>
Lang residence. Hudson?<End>
Matthew?<End>
I thought it was Hudson calling to say he
was coming home.
We're newlyweds, you know.<End>
Oh, right.<End>
I have to get the dinner ready!
See you!<End>
Hello, who's calling?<End>
Matthew?
Matthew Williams?
What are you doing calling at this hour?<End>
You want Mary Lou for something?<End>
No...<End>
It's late. This can wait until tomorrow.<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Who's calling?
Matthew? You want to know if there's
any news on Emma?<End>
When you called this late, I thought
something bad had happened...<End>
All right, I'll help you, but don't tell
Morgan.<End>
Morgan said that we need to know more
about Emma first.<End>
We need to know what Emma was
interested in, what kinds of places
she frequented...<End>
I think you should try to find out what
you don't already know about her.<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Matthew, what's up? Can't sleep
because you're worried about Emma?<End>
You and Mel couldn't be more different...<End>
He's always riding that motorbike
around town... I bet he stays out
all night.<End>
He seems like he's full of secrets.<End>
I bet you'd find all kinds of secret stuff
if you searched that kid's room.<End>
Oh yes, indeed...<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Matthew? You want to talk about Kathy?<End>
I see...<End>
Father Barton expected a lot from her...<End>
I think he was a bit too harsh, though.
I know I couldn't have handled that.<End>
Apparently he waits outside of the bar
to preach to young people.<End>
Unbelievable...<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Matthew, what's up?
You want to know what's going on at the
department?<End>
I'm making a list of places of interest.<End>
The farm workers' lodgings, The Ruins,
now they're creepy.<End>
Plus, you never know who's living at that
disaster area apartment building...<End>
I doubt anyone normal would be seen in
a place like that...<End>
Oh, I forgot... your uncle lives there,
doesn't he?
I'm sorry...<End>
It's okay. Uncle's definitely not normal.<End>
Lang residence.<End>
Matthew, what's up?
You want to know what the current
status is?<End>
Hmm, where to begin...<End>
You know, I've set up a crime board
in the interrogation room.<End>
If I could refer to that, it would be much
easier to catch you up on everything...<End>
I think that if we consider everything
on the board, something will stand out.<End>
Come see it tomorrow, why don't you.<End>
