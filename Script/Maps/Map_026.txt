About Kathy's cause of death...<End>
It was shock, wasn't it?<End>
Yeah, but it doesn't quite make sense.

Is that really what she died of?<End>
You have certain memories too,
don't you?

The ones that pop into your head after<New>
years and years of having forgotten
them.

Vivid and clear.<End>
It's the same thing.<End>
But, doesn't the catalyst for a
flashback have to be something
connected with the memory itself?<End>
Kathy was attacked by a bear.

What could make her flash back to that
night in the woods?<End>
Something clearly did. 
Something
strong enough to bring back the
terror of the woods.<End>
What could it be...?<End>
No idea. Only Kathy could tell you.<End>
Epoch, huh?<End>
Yeah, it's unbelievable...<End>
So after everything, Emma was doing
drugs.<End>
I don't know. 
In her diary, she said that
she didn't want to rely on something
like that.
<New>
I'm sure she never actually took it.<End>
Her diary, huh...
 
What else did she write?<End>
She wrote that Kathy said she
"needed it".

Oh, right!  If she was talking about<New>
Epoch, then that means that Kathy was
trying to get some.<End>
But what would she "need" it for...?<End>
Probably to escape from reality.

Perhaps she thought she could get
some relief from her trouble by using it.<New>

But the issue is where she got the Epoch
from.<End>
I think it must have been Mel?<End>
Well in that case, where did Mel get it
from?<End>
I don't...<End>
Listen, I think Emma is still alive.

What if she's being held captive by
these Epoch dealers?<End>
Who could have given Emma Epoch...?

Him! That bald guy...!<End>
Do you know something about that cave
mural in the forest?<End>
Mural?
You saw it?
 In the area that's blocked off?<End>
Yeah.<End>
It seems to be around a thousand
years old.
It depicts an ancient ritual.<End>
There were people lying on the ground
underneath what looked like a sun.<End>
No, it's not a sun. 
It's something else...
And those people aren't just lying down.
They're dead.<End>
It's a ritual to mourn the dead?<End>
No, the opposite... it's a ritual to bring
the dead back to life again.<End>
Bring them... back to life?<End>
Yup. 
So, why are you asking about the
mural? <End>
I think Emma went to look at it too.

I wanted to know why she'd be
interested in something like that.<End>
I see...<End>
I told you Emma was having doubts
about the meaning of life, right? <End>
Yeah...<End>
Well, I don't think it was about that
at all. I think she was worrying about
death.<New>

To ponder life is to ponder death,
after all. <End>
...What does that mean, then?<End>
According to my research the native
tribespeople were able to die whilst
still living. <End>
What does THAT mean?<End>
The ritual shown in the painting...

it's known as the Death Journey Ritual.
It involves killing a person and then<New>
bringing them back to life. <End>
I wonder if Emma wanted to experience
the world of death...<End>
Who knows... perhaps it's natural to
want to understand life by
experiencing death, just once.<End>
There's nothing natural about that!<End>
By the way, since the mural's off-limits,
how did you manage to see it?<End>
I asked Cohen to let me in.<End>
Cohen?

Morgan said that the government's in
charge of it.<End>
Oh, don't you know?
 Cohen used to be a
colonel in the military.

So he has a bit more jurisdiction than<New>
the average joe. <End>
Cohen...? 
I didn't know that... 
so that's
why Morgan's having him patrol the
forest.<End>
Precisely.<End>
Do you know about the murder that
happened in this town 40 years ago?<End>
...<End>
Yes, I know of it.<End>
Why was Emma interested in that case?<End>
This is the first I've heard of that.
Still, if Emma knew about the case,
I'm not surprised if she took an<New>
interest in it.<End>
The ritual that Cougar performed is
the same one that's shown in the
cave mural, right?<End>
Yes. 
He used a young girl to do the
Death Journey Ritual.<End>
What the hell is all this about doing the
Death Journey Ritual
 to get eternal life?<End>
It seems he believed that those who
succeed at the Death Journey Ritual
are granted eternal life for<New>
completing such a dangerous journey.<End>
That's insane!<End>
Yes, well. Eternal life might be
stretching it, but apparently some
have lived for 400 years or more.<End>
400 years?! That can't be right!<End>
You're as thick-headed as ever.<End>
But that doesn't make any logical sense.

I can't believe Cougar honestly
believed that...<End>
No matter how much humans attempt
to apply logic to things,
we still have a tendency to believe in<New>
things beyond the realms of science or
common sense.<End>
...
I wonder if Emma believed in the ritual,
too...<End>
That's what I think.<End>
Do you have a minute?<End>
Sure. What is it this time?<End>
We know that Emma and Kathy met at
the forest on the night of the 24th.
But what we need to know is what<New>
they did there.<End>
You're wondering if they did the ritual
or not.<End>
Yeah.<End>
Yeah, no doubt about it.<End>
But how would Emma know how to
perform it?<End>
Hmm, you've got a point.
I've never spoken to Emma about the
ritual.<End>
The specifics of the ritual weren't
reported in any newspapers from
back then.<End>
Maybe it wasn't Emma, but Kathy who
knew how to do it?

She was raised in the church.<New>

It wouldn't surprise me if she knew
all about Cougar.<End>
But in her letter, Kathy said that
Emma's the one who invited her.<End>
Still, maybe Kathy knew about the ritual,
but wasn't too interested in
performing it.<New>
But then, Emma got interested.
After all, Emma was really interested
in the case from 40 years ago, right?<End>
I see...<End>
It seems that Emma and Kathy
definitely did the Death Journey Ritual
that night.<End>
How do you know?<End>
Cohen said that the necklace found on
the body of the bear that attacked Kathy
was a traditonal part of the ritual.<End>
The Prophet necklace...<End>
Is something wrong?<End>
...No...
Where is the necklace now?<End>
I think it's at the sheriff's department.<End>
I see.<End>
I heard from Cohen that people who do
the Death Journey ritual meet with the
"Mizzurna."<End>
Yes, they meet with, and become one
with the Mizzurna, and then they are
reborn.<End>
What IS this Mizzurna?<End>
...The Mizzurna, huh?
<End>
Come to my house tonight. 
I'll tell you
everything I know about the
Mizzurna and the Death Journey Ritual.<End>
What time should I come?<End>
Come to my house around 11:30pm.<End>
All right.<End>
So, Dennis committed suicide.<End>
Yeah. I can't believe he's the one who
brought Epoch into the town.

Too many unbelievable things<New>
are happening.<End>
Kathy getting attacked by a bear, Emma
going missing, the town getting flooded
with drugs, Isabella getting shot.<End>
This seems like such a nice, peaceful
town, but a hell of a lot's been going on
in the shadows.<End>
Isabella said that Emma is alive.

And Dennis was involved in Emma's
disappearance.<End>
You mean, Dennis was holding Emma
prisoner like he was doing to Isabella?<End>
No doubt about it.<End>
That may be so, but I doubt finding Emma
is going to be as simple as looking in
Dennis's house or the Astin Farm<New>
warehouse.<End>
...I guess you're right.<End>
But now that Dennis is dead, there's no
reason for Emma to be kept alive any
more. 
We have to hurry and find her...<End>
I wonder. I mean, they haven't killed her
yet. 
Maybe there's some other reason
they haven't killed her, unlike with<New>
Isabella.<End>
What reason?<End>
I don't know. Just, I don't think they're
keeping Emma prisoner just because
she bought some Epoch.<End>
