What's that?<End>
Do you know what it's used with?<End>
I haven't got a clue.<End>
No idea, none at all.<End>
Isabella, hmm...<End>
If you know anything...<End>
Sorry.
I've never spoken to the woman.<End>
Ask someone else, okay?<End>
Do you know what this key is for?<End>
Hmm?
I think I've seen that key before...<End>
I think Winona has one just like it...
unless I imagined it.<End>
...Winona did?<End>
Yeah, but there's a ton of keys around.<End>
Looks like the same kind of key Winona
has.<End>
What?<End>
...You're not asking me to give this to
Winona for you, are you?!<End>
What? N-No, I...<End>
Haha, just kidding!
Anyway, what's this for?<End>
Uh, never mind...<End>
Something you need?<End>
Have you seen this camera before?<End>
Hmm, Matthew...<End>
Carrying a camera around now?<End>
Are you getting interested in
photography?<End>
Photography's a fascinating subject.
I used to dabble myself, at one time...<End>
I see...<End>
But you won't take any prize shots with
that thing.<End>
Still, best of luck, Matthew.<End>
Looks like you've gained Morgan's trust.<End>
Yes. I'm gonna do my best to help out.<End>
You're growing into a fine young man.<End>
Give it your all, son.<End>
Wearing a ring, though you're a guy,
Matthew?<End>
It was in Emma's house.<End>
So it's Emma's ring?<End>
It looks a bit clunky for her style.<End>
Interested in rings, are you?<End>
Please take a look at this.<End>
I see. So Emma and Kathy were together
that night.<End>
Yes...<End>
So Emma must have gone to the forest,
too.<End>
What's that?<End>
Do you know anything about it?<End>
It's a bag of pills, isn't it?<End>
I don't know?<End>
This is the off-limits area in the forest.<End>
Have you ever been inside?<End>
Nope, not myself. But there's some sort
of mural in there. Can't imagine anyone
wanting to go in there.<End>
So she went in there, huh?<End>
Can you tell me what you know about
this envelope?<End>
Huh? What's this?
I've lived in this town many years,
but I've never heard of this.<End>
Looks quite complex.
Must be some sort of secret project.<End>
What could it be?<End>
Oh... Matthew.<End>
You've started smoking?
I don't think much of that.<End>
No, you've got it wrong.<End>
Smoking's bad enough, but lying's worse.<End>
What's this?<End>
Not sure...<End>
I see...<End>
What is it?<End>
That's some necklace.
Seems very old.
You're into stuff like this?<End>
Uh, no...
Have you seen it before?<End>
Don't think so.
It looks native.
<End>
Sorry, please ask someone else.<End>
