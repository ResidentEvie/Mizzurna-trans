Yeah...<End>
Understood. I'm heading for the hospital
now. 
Tell Father Burton to come too.<End>
Matthew? Change of plan. 
Kathy's
regained consciousness.<End>
I'm going to Grouver Hospital.
Want to come with?<End>
Okay.<End>
Grouver Hospital<End>
Let me ask you something...<End>
Emma's mother seemed extremely
upset when she called about Emma
this morning.<End>
But she couldn't have heard about Kathy
yet. It's on a need-to-know basis only.<End>
I see...<End>
Well, Emma's the kind of girl where
nobody ever knows what she's thinking.<End>
Sometimes she just seemed completely
deep in thought about something.<End>
Emma? 
I never had that impression
whenever I saw her.<End>
She wasn't always like that.<End>
I guess you could say she was like a
fragile glass, beautiful to look at, but
liable to break at any moment.<End>
I don't really want to say it, but
I wonder if she's killed herself...<End>
Then maybe Sarah's worried about that,
too.<End>
I wonder if Emma was suffering inside. <End>
Perhaps...<End>
Weren't you friends with her?<End>
Winona was her best friend.

I'm a guy, so... 
we couldn't be friends in
the same way.<End>
Matthew!<End>
Winona, why are you here?<End>
I went to the sheriff's department and
heard you were here.<End>
Right...
Did you see Morgan?<End>
Yeah.
And I heard about Kathy, as well...<End>
Morgan's opened an official <02> missing
persons investigation about Emma.<End>
I see...<End>
Do you think that Emma and Kathy were
together last night?<End>
I don't know.<End>
I think... Emma must also be...<End>
I'm sure that Emma is just fine.<End>
But, 
what did happen to Emma?<End>
So many things are happening, it's too
confusing. <End>
...<End>
I bet there's a lot that we can do to help
out.<End>
I'm going to the sheriff's department
to see Morgan.
 Want to come with me?<End>
I think I'll go to Emma's house.

I'm worried about Sarah.<End>
I see.<End>
Thanks for the car, Matthew. <End>
Huh?
Oh, right, you came in my car.<End>
Uncle Nozz said I could borrow it.<End>
I'll drive you to Emma's house.<End>
No, it's okay.

It's not far, and I feel like walking.<End>
I see.
 If anything happens, call my cell
phone.<End>
Okay.<End>
The last words  Kathy said, 
as she
screamed...<End>
"Don't"...<End>
What's the connection between Emma
and Kathy?<End>
Something happened to Emma, no doubt
about it.<Unk70>
We don't even know if she's still alive...<End>
Winona Ringwald (18)<End>
Matthew's classmate, 
and Emma's
best friend.<End>
She was one of the few people that
Emma could open herself up to.<End>
