Matthew! There really was a bear in
the forest!

We found some huge paw prints!<End>
Can't wait for tomorrow! <End>
Are you going to do another search
tomorrow?<End>
Yeah, but Cohen's suggested we go with
fewer people tomorrow.<End>
He says it's best to use a small team
when tracking a bear. <End>
What time are you going in? <End>
We're meeting at the forest entrance,

at 7am tomorrow morning.<End>
Can I join, too?<End>
Sorry, I can't bring you with me.

Morgan'll wring my neck.<End>
Couldn't you please let me join?<End>
I don't mind, but Morgan...
 believe me,
I'd be totally fine with you coming, 
but... <End>
Did Morgan let you join the bear hunt?<End>
No. In fact, he said...<End>
What? What did he say? Is he saying
my gun skills aren't good enough?<End>
I could shoot better than Morgan 
even if I was blindfolded!<End>
That's it! 
Matthew, come to the forest
tomorrow!<End>
We'll catch that bear and make
Morgan eat his words!<End>
I don't think Morgan will let me.<End>
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.<End>
Just come to the forest at 7am
tomorrow.

Make sure to wake up bright and early.<End>
