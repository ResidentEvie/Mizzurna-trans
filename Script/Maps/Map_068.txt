Holden residence.<End>
I'm not home right now, so please leave
a message.<End>
Oh, her answering machine.
Guess I'll call back later.<End>
She must have gone to bed already.
I'll call another time.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew?
It's late, can we speak tomorrow
instead?<End>
I'm incredibly tired...<End>
I'm sorry...<End>
That's all right.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew, good morning.<End>
I'm just off to school right now.
Come and find me in the teachers' room
if you need me.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew? What's wrong?<End>
Nothing...<End>
If you're upset about Emma, you can talk
to me.<End>
It's all right.<End>
Oh, okay. I guess you're a guy.<End>
Can I call you again sometime?<End>
Sure, as long as it's not late at night.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew... don't think too much about the
Emma situation.<End>
At times like these, you end up having
all kinds of dark thoughts...<End>
Yeah.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew? Why are you calling this late?<End>
You're up late too, aren't you,
Miss Holden?<End>
Yes... I'm worried about Emma, too.<End>
Sorry... I know I told you not to think
about it too much, but here I am...<End>
Miss Holden...<End>
I'm all right.<End>
You ARE at home right now, aren't you,
Matthew?<End>
I know that Mr. Nozz is quite laid-back,
but you shouldn't be walking around at
night... get some rest, okay?<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew...<End>
Emma was all alone, with her troubles...<End>
If that's why she's gone missing, then
maybe I'm partly responsible...<End>
I couldn't help her... my own student...<End>
Miss Holden...<End>
I'm sorry... I'm... all right.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew...<End>
Matthew, Emma trusted me, but I failed
her...<End>
She was interested in some strange
things...<End>
I don't know why...
and I don't much care.<End>
Why did she come to me?<End>
Maybe, because I pray at the church...<End>
It's not that I believe in God, though...<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew...<End>
Hmm? Why do I go to the church?<End>
I don't really believe in God...
I just wanted... some support...<End>
Matthew, sometimes we need a little
help in life.<End>
Human beings aren't strong enough
to live all alone.<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew, life is strange...<End>
Everyone has different interests,
different mindsets...<End>
But we're all equal.<End>
I don't know how Emma was feeling,
but... both Emma and I had our own
struggles...<End>
Neither of us should hold onto them...<End>
I've always tried not to...<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew...<End>
What was Emma looking for in her life?
I think that's the key to everything in this
case.<End>
I shouldn't say this, but I wonder if
Emma simply wanted to die...<End>
How... pointless, if that was the case.<End>
We'll all die someday, so why wish for
it...?<End>
I want to help her, somehow...<End>
If she comes back... I want to help her
start her life over.<End>
She still has so much to look forward
to...<End>
Holden residence.<End>
Matthew, good morning.
I guess it's the final day of the year.<End>
I wonder if Emma will come back to us,
before the new year begins...<End>
I'd like to leave all the horrible things
that have happened in this year.<End>
I'll be at the school again today.<End>
I don't really have any work to do...
But, I want to keep busy...<End>
