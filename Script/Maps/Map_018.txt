Do you know what this is?<End>
Let's see.<End>
...Is she up to something?<End>
What do you mean?<End>
Isabella?<End>
Her song's on this tape.<End>
She gave this to you?<End>
Yeah.<End>
That's surprising. Isabella hates most
people.
How'd you win her over?<End>
Good song, isn't it?<End>
Can you take a look at this key?<End>
Huh?<End>
Why?<End>
Doesn't seem to know anything about it...<End>
I said, what's with that?<End>
What's with that?<End>
Why would someone rent a motel room
in the town they live in?<End>
Probably for something dodgy.<End>
Like what?<End>
Like something dodgy!<End>
I ain't ever been to the motel.<End>
What's with the camera?
You gonna take creep shots of Isabella?<End>
N-No...<End>
Better not.<End>
Isabella hates stalkers and creeps.<End>
I'd never do something like that.<End>
What you showin' me that for?<End>
Pfft...
What you flashin' that thing at me for?<End>
No real reason...<End>
You gonna arrest me?<End>
Feel free to play cop all you like.
But don't go sticking your neck in
where it's not wanted.<End>
What's that dumb old sheriff thinking,
giving something like that to a kid?<End>
...<End>
What's with the ring?<End>
I found it in Emma's room.<End>
In Emma's room...?<End>
Do you know anything about that ring?<End>
No...<End>
Well, no need for you to know. But don't
go around flashing it at
people.<End>
Why not?<End>
That ring is worn by bad guys.<End>
Bad guys?<End>
Yeah, they come in here, causing trouble.<End>
I don't really know much about it, but
that ring seems to be how they identify
their fellows.<End>
I see...<End>
Listen to my advice.
It's for your own good.
Don't go flashing that at people.<End>
Hmm.
Kathy wrote this?<End>
It's one of our flyers, yeah.<End>
Did you know she was coming here?<End>
Huh, well.
It's not like she was a regular.<End>
Did she come with Emma?<End>
Never saw her and Emma talk to each
other.<End>
I see...<End>
...<End>
That priest kicked up a huge stink
'cause Kathy came to the bar.<End>
How did Kathy act, when she came to the
bar?<End>
Dunno...
I don't know how she acted when she
WASN'T at the bar.<End>
What I can say is that she really went
wild here. Letting off steam, you know.
Must have been stressed.<End>
Emma and Kathy must have become
buddies somewhere else.<End>
Just cause this is my flyer, don't mean
they made plans with each other while
they were at MY bar.<End>
You...<End>
What's that?<End>
Just wondering what kind of pills
these are.<End>
...<End>
Where did you get those?<End>
At the motel.
From a room I think Mel rented.<End>
I can find out what they are for ya.<End>
Huh?<End>
Like I said, I can identify those.<End>
You know about drugs?<End>
I didn't say that.
I've got a friend who's a pharmacologist.<End>
No thanks, I'm planning to ask Doctor
Samuel.<End>
Well, fine.
Ignore my kind offer.
That's just charming.<End>
Don't blame me if they're flu pills and
you wasted a doctor's time.<End>
About this place...<End>
What?<End>
What's that?<End>
Can't see how that's got anything to do
with me.<End>
Do you know anything about this?<End>
Project Mizzurna?
Never heard of it.<End>
Nothing to do with me.<End>
Keep asking, my answer won't change.<End>
What's with the smokes?
You giving these to me?<End>
Blue in the Face?
I don't smoke that brand.<End>
What's the difference?<End>
There's a huge difference!
Only old farts and old bags smoke those!<End>
I told you, I don't want 'em!<End>
What's that?<End>
It's the key to Cohen's lodge.<End>
Huh? What are you on about?
I don't know that guy. I don't give a shit
about any key.<End>
Don't make me repeat myself, kid.<End>
Looks like an old piece of junk.

That yours?<End>
It seems it was found in the church
originally.<End>
Huh.
Must be some sacred relic.<End>
Well, it's got nothin' to do with me.<End>
