Hold on a moment.<End>
Who are you?<End>
I'm James, the psychiatric counsellor.
You're Matthew, aren't you?<End>
Yeah. I've heard about you.

You research indigenous tribes, right?<End>
That's just a hobby of mine.<End>
How did you know my name?<End>
Just a guess.

I heard all about you from Emma.<End>
From Emma?<End>
She came to see me many times for
counselling.<End>
She did?

I never heard anything about that...<End>
This case is going to be difficult.<End>
What... makes you say that?<End>
Do you believe in the supernatural?<End>
Like what exactly?<End>
For example... Let me think.
Like ghosts, or supernatural abilities...
That kind of thing.<End>
Hmm, I wonder... I guess I don't believe
in it, really.<Unk70>
I've never come across anything like<New>
that in my life so far, anyway.<End>
What about you?<End>
I think I have.<End>
So the world's split into the natural
world, 
and the supernatural world,

two worlds, right?<End>
No, there's only one world.<End>
It's our lack of understanding that's
caused us to define them as two
different things.<End>
...<End>
What does this have to do with anything?<End>
This case is humming with supernatural
energy.<End>
About Emma... was there anything
psychologically abnormal about her?<End>
Abnormal...?<End>
It depends on how you define abnormal...
She did talk about a strange dream she
often had.<End>
Let's see, she was also having some...
philosophical doubts. <End>
Philosophical doubts?<End>
"Am I truly alive?"<End>
"Am I truly alive?"
...
Well, wasn't she?<End>
Of course.

But this was buried deeper in her
psyche.<End>
I think she was questioning the meaning
of life.

Perhaps doubting her own existence.<End>
I don't get it.<End>
Well, it's incorrect to call that abnormal
thinking.<End>
Humans have been questioning the
meaning of life since forever.<End>
I see...<End>
Anyway, that's how it is.<End>
So what about the strange dream she
was having?<End>
A blue light, distorted space... celestial
hymns... eternal sleep, welcoming her
from within.<End>
Heaven? 
Everyone has dreams like that.<End>
It's not just that.

Her body melted away, eaten by animals.<End>
She enters a world where she can see
and hear nothing. And then she wakes,
with a sense that she is not really<New>
herself.<End>
Gross...<End>
Either way, it's obvious she was living in
fear of something, 
but I don't know what.<End>
She had worries she couldn't discuss
with anyone. 
I think she was struggling
mentally.<End>
Doctor Loloma, you have a patient
waiting in Exam Room 2.<End>
Oh, I completely forgot.<End>
Matthew, 
I'm concerned about Emma, too.<End>
If you find out anything, please come and
see me.<End>
I'll be having a drink at Bar Wolves

from around 8pm.<End>
Okay.<End>
James Loloma (35)<End>
A psychiatrist at Grouver Hospital
specialising in counselling.<End>
He's an expert on Western philosophy
and logic, and is knowledgeable enough
about both to be a university lecturer<New>
on these subjects. He is currently
conducting historical research into the
indigenous tribes of this region. <End>
