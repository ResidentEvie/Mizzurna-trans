No answer... guess nobody's home.
I'll call back later.<End>
He must be asleep already.
I should call another time.<End>
Yes, Morgan here.<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
When the phone rings at this time of
night, what am I supposed to think?<End>
If it's not urgent, leave it for now.<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan?<End>
Morgan's home late tonight, as always.
He won't be home before midnight, dear.<End>
Yes, Morgan here.<End>
Oh, Matthew...<End>
I was just heading to the department.
I'll be there from 8, so stop by.<End>
Yes, Morgan here.<End>
Oh, Matthew... what's up?<End>
I'd like you to let me join in tomorrow's
bear hunt.<End>
Matthew, I can't permit that.
It's too dangerous.<End>
Just leave it to us.
I've got an early start tomorrow, so I'm
hanging up now.<End>
Okay.<End>
Yes, Morgan here.<End>
Oh, Matthew...
I'm just off out. It's time for the bear
hunt.<End>
And no, I can't let you come, so drop it.<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Oh, Morgan? No, he's not back from work
yet.<End>
And when he does come home, all he
talks about is work.<End>
Just yesterday, he was saying how that
Mel boy is suspicious.<End>
Well, this case IS unprecedented...<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan's at work.
He's home late every night. I'm worried
for his health.<End>
Last night, he was talking in his sleep.
Something about, that farm workers'
lodgings would be the ideal place<New>
for criminals to lie low.<End>
He even talks about work in his sleep!<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan's at work.<End>
Hmm? You want to know if he said
anything last night?<End>
Yes, he said that the "bar singer" must
be connected to young Emma somehow.<End>
Who's the bar singer, that's what I'd like
to know...<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan's at work. He said he's going to
go without proper sleep until he finds
Emma...<End>
I wonder where that young girl
could be...<End>
Isn't she just hiding somewhere?<End>
Now, if someone in town wanted to hide
out, they'd probably go to the motel.
Get some privacy.<End>
But surely she's not just doing that...
Oh dear, I shouldn't be telling you all this
about my husband's work...<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan? Oh, he's not home yet, dear.
He won't be home until late.<End>
I wish he would take better care of his
health...<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Oh? You want to talk to ME?
You want to know if Morgan said
anything yesterday?<End>
Yes, he spoke about Cohen.<End>
Morgan was saying, Cohen must have his
own reasons for overseeing the forest.<End>
He also said... it probably wasn't
coincidence that Cohen was there
that morning to find Kathy.<End>
Oh, that doesn't mean he suspects Cohen
of anything, though.<End>
Morgan trusts Cohen completely.<End>
Yes, Morgan here.<End>
Oh, Matthew... good morning.
Guess we've made it to the 31st.<End>
I wanted to have Emma found by the end
of the year.<End>
Steve and Sarah should be able to greet
the new year happily...<End>
Hello, Stein residence.<End>
Morgan's at work.
Oh, you want to know where?<End>
Well he was saying the hospital and the
bar are key to this case. So maybe
around there?<End>
He also said something about a singer
named Isabella being important.
I hope that helps, dear.<End>
