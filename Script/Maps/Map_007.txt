What's this?<End>
It was in Emma's locker.<End>
Huh. In Emma's locker?<End>
It might contain important data.<End>
Yes.<End>
Find someone, anyone with a PC.<End>
Ask someone who knows about
technology.<End>
What's that?<End>
Isabella's music.<End>
Did she give that to you?<End>
Yeah.<End>
...Not bad, Matthew!
You broke through her stage persona
to the woman within. That's huge.<End>
I didn't... break through anything...<End>
Well, whatever.
Still, fabulous song, isn't it?<End>
Yeah, apparently it's based on a melody
she heard during a near-death
experience...<End>
A... near death experience?<End>
A song she heard for the first time in
death... and yet we're so quick to
dismiss the possibility of an afterlife.<End>
I would dearly love to have my own
near-death experience.<End>
So, a key found hidden in Emma's room,
eh?<End>
Do you happen to know what it unlocks?<End>
Sorry, even I don't know everything.<End>
So you just found it tossed into an empty
vase?<End>
Doesn't sound like a place you'd hide
something special or secret. More likely
it's just some everyday object.<End>
I see...<End>
I doubt it's anything important.<End>
"9pm, motel"...?
What's this?<End>
I think Mel stayed at the motel.<End>
I'd like to know more.<End>
Hmm, I see.<End>
You should ask the guy at the front desk
to show you the guest register.<End>
I see.<End>
That's all the help I can give you there.<End>
Did you take pictures with this?<End>
No, I found that in Emma's locker.<End>
Oh, in Emma's locker, eh?
Interesting.<End>
I plan to get the film developed.<End>
You do just that.<End>
It's bound to reveal some clue about
Emma.<End>
Hurry up and get those photos developed.<End>
Hello, Junior Detective!<End>
Please cut that out.<End>
Haha. Still, guess this means you've
passed police muster.<End>
Yeah, and I'm gonna find Emma!<End>
That's the spirit, Junior Detective!<End>
Go find Emma!<End>
What's this?<End>
I don't think it's Emma's...<End>
I never saw her wear a ring like that.<End>
There's a letter I on it. Any ideas?<End>
...No, no idea.<End>
Doesn't seem like this was Emma's.<End>
Hmm.
So they went to the forest together.<End>
But what did they go there to do?<End>
And was it just the two of them?
That's the crucial issue here.<End>
Yes, that's true.<End>
I believe Emma is alive.<End>
But I doubt we'll be able to find her until
we figure out the answers to both
questions.<End>
Those two issues, they're the key to
everything.<End>
What are these pills?<End>
I was hoping to get them analyzed.<End>
I could do that for you, but I'm a bit busy.<End>
Ask the head doctor.<End>
Sorry, I'm busy.<End>
This is the no entry sign, from the
forest, right?<End>
I don't know why it's blocked off, either.<End>
There's a cave painting inside there.
Native. Maybe Morgan will let you in
there if you ask him.<End>
I see...<End>
It's hardly heavily secured. You could
just climb over that fence.<End>
That's true...<End>
There's not a lot of literature on that
painting. 
Someone who's lived in town
a long time might know more about it.<End>
What's that envelope?<End>
Cohen asked me to bring it.<End>
Never heard of that project before.<End>
Cohen... so, maybe some kind of military
project?<End>
Some connection between this town and
the military...<End>
Seriously, Matthew?<End>
An upstanding young man like you,
smoking?<End>
...I don't smoke.<End>
Is that so?<End>
What's that key for?<End>
It's the key to Cohen's lodge.<End>
Hmm...<End>
I don't know anything about that.<End>
How do you like the necklace?
Feel any sacred power emanating
from it?<End>
...No, not at all.<End>
Hahaha! Well, whatever.
 Just make sure
to return it to the station without
losing it.<End>
If you find anything out, let me know.<End>
