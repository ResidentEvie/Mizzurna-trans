What's this?<End>
Emma had it.<End>
I see. I'm sorry, but I have no hints
to give.<End>
I do hope we find some clues.<End>
I'm praying we'll find something.<End>
Isabella...<End>
Oh yes, the singer at the bar.<End>
Do you know of her?<End>
Matthew... are you frequenting that
bar?<End>
Stay away from that place.

Live your life decently.<End>
Matthew...
Good deeds bring us closer to God.<End>
A key...?<End>
Do you have any ideas?<End>
It's quite nondescript.<End>
I don't think I recall anything.<End>
I see...<End>
It's not for any door we have here.<End>
The motel... 
Mel Astin?<End>
The 23rd...<End>
Huh?<End>
That boy, he's always going to the bar,
isn't he?<End>
Yes... yes, it would seem so...<End>
So many delinquents like him these
days...<End>
Young people have their youth to enjoy,
yet they waste their time partying
at night...<End>
Matthew, at your age, you'll be tempted
by many salacious things.<End>
You should think of your future first,
in every choice you make.<End>
Keep yourself to high moral standards.
Do not stray from God's path.<End>
A camera?<End>
This was in Emma's locker.<End>
If Kathy's on these photos, it will prove
a connection between them.<End>
...I don't think they had anything to do
with each other.<End>
Still, I think it should give us some clues.<End>
I see.<End>
I hope it helps you find Emma...<End>
So it seems the police have taken you
under their wing.<End>
It's not official or anything, though.<End>
Matthew, you have a strong sense of
justice.<End>
This too is part of God's plan.<End>
I hope you find Emma.<End>
What's this ring?<End>
Have you ever seen it?<End>
I don't know...
I do not wear such things.<End>
Yes?<End>
Kathy... wrote this...<End>
It seems certain now that they went to
the forest together.<End>
...<End>
Do you have any idea what they might
have gone there to do?<End>
...I do not know.<End>
But it must have been something
immoral.<End>
Otherwise, why would they hide it from
me, from you?<End>
But...<End>
That child... she was raised with God.
She had a duty, to follow the holy path.<End>
I do not think my teachings were
wrong...<End>
So why... why did she stray so far?<End>
There is nothing more I can ever do for
her.<End>
What's that?<End>
I found them in the motel room Kathy
used...<End>
?!<End>
I'm not sure what they are, so I'm
thinking of asking Doctor Samuel to
identify them.<End>
The devil's drug!
You must throw them away, at once!<End>
Father Barton?<End>
I'm sorry...
 My mistake...<End>
Anyway, I'll try to find out what they are.<End>
Matthew!<End>
...Nothing...<End>
My Kathy did not touch drugs, so I know
they aren't hers.<End>
Matthew, you must never go in there.<End>
Why not?<End>
The devil resides in there.<End>
Do you understand me? 
You must not go
near that place!<End>
What's that envelope?<End>
If you know something about it, please
tell me.<End>
I'm sorry... 
I cannot help you.<End>
I don't know.<End>
I do not smoke.<End>
Oh, right.<End>
Matthew...
 You don't smoke... do you?
<End>
What is wrong, my child?<End>
Um, about this...<End>
Hmm, a key.<End>
What about it?<End>
What is wrong, child?<End>
A cursed item. 
Linked to Kathy's death...<End>
I see...
If you know anything, please tell me?<End>
I don't wish to look at that anymore.
It is cursed.<End>
I don't want to look at that.<End>
